# Readme

This repository contains the code and data used for a literature review on the use of factorial meta-analysis/meta-analysis of interaction in Ecology.

Scripts:



The version of the R package 'revtools'[https://revtools.net/] used differs between scripts, which means that the code used in script "001deduplicating_references.R" would need adjusting from revtools v.0.2.0 to v.0.3.0.

The literature search was conducted on the 15th of November, 2018. 

The screening of titles and abstracts was conducted using https://rayyan.qcri.org.

Addtional information regarding the literature review can be found in: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlEl7E_svDc9WiZDHy1V4DMDlvqfyKpjildiH2duL4I/edit?usp=sharing
