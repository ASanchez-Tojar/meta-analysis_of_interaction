This repository contains the code and data used for a literature review on the use of factorial meta-analysis/meta-analysis of interaction in Ecology.

The version of the R package 'revtools' used differs among scripts, which means that the code used in script "001deduplicating_references.R" would need adjusting from revtools v.0.2.0 to v.0.3.0.

The literature search was conducted on the 15th of November, 2018. 

The titles and abstracts screening was conducted using https://rayyan.qcri.org.
