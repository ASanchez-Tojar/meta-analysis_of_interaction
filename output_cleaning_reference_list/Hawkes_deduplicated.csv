Vegetation response to these effects are variable. Wild large herbivore populations are declining globally, but how tree communities respond to this change is not clear. We experimentally examined how tree communities respond to changes in ungulate abundance in a heterogeneous landscape. Location: Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda. Methods: We recorded tree species in nine replicate sites each with four treatment plots: fenced off-mound (excluding ungulates), unfenced off-mound, fenced and unfenced on-mound. Each species was assessed for fruit type, leafing strategy, spinescence and bark thickness. We compared tree communities on- and off-mound, with and without ungulates using PERMANOVA, and the effects of habitat, fencing and time on stem density and traits using generalized linear mixed effects model. Results: Stem density increased by 88% off-mound and 138% on-mound (p=0.005) with fencing, between 2006 and 2015. Whether tree communities occurred on- or off-mound determined species composition, but fencing had little effect. Tree traits were not markedly altered by fencing on-mound. Off-mound, fencing was associated with a 38% increase in the proportion of fleshy-fruited tree stems (p<0.001), 18% decline in armed tree stems (p=0.035) and a 44% reduction in mean bark thickness (p=0.001). Conclusion: Our study highlights the important role mounds play in maintaining tree community composition with declining ungulate abundance. While ungulates influence tree communities off-mounds they have little effect on tree composition and traits of mound-borne trees. Thus, Macrotermes mounds support distinct tree communities that are robust to exclusion of ungulates.  2018 International Association for Vegetation Science",1,1

Buttonwood is polymorphic, with green shrubs producing few leaf trichomes and silver shrubs covered in dense trichomes. We first characterize traits of green vs. silver shrubs relevant for herbivores, and then assay damage by two prominent insects. Next, on replicated islands, we experimentally address how different types of storm damage (simulated hurricane surge damage vs. simulated intense wind) affected phenotypic traits of both buttonwood morphs and subsequent herbivory over a one-year sampling period. Our results show that although leaves produced by green shrubs are 21% tougher than leaves produced by silver shrubs, green leaves have 16% higher nitrogen concentrations and greater levels of herbivory. Consistent with previous observational studies of a natural hurricane at our study site, we found stronger effects of simulated surge damage than simulated wind damage. Experimental pruning of shrubs resulted in reduced toughness, higher nitrogen concentration, fewer trichomes, and greater herbivory compared to controls and compared to shrubs with their leaves stripped. The results were stronger for the silver compared to the green morph. Morph differences in buttonwood have strong consequences for herbivores, and these effects are modified by disturbance.",2,2

This includes plant responses to trophic interactions such as herbivory and mycorrhizal symbiosis which are concurrent in most plants. We explored fitness costs of 50% manual defoliation and mycorrhizal inoculation in Datura stramonium at different light availability and soil fertility environments in a greenhouse experiment. Overall, we showed that non-inoculated and mycorrhiza-inoculated plants did not suffer from 50% manual defoliation in all the tested combinations of light availability and soil fertility treatments, while soil nutrients and light availability predominately affected plant responses to the mycorrhizal inoculation. Fifty percent defoliation had a direct negative effect on reproductive traits whereas mycorrhiza-inoculated plants produced larger flowers than non-inoculated plants when light was not a limiting factor. Although D. stramonium is a facultative selfing species, other investigations had shown clear advantages of cross-pollination in this species; therefore, the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on flower size observed in this study open new lines of inquiry for our understanding of plant responses to trophic interactions. Also in this study, we detected shifts in the limiting resources affecting plant responses to trophic interactions.  2011 Springer-Verlag.",3,2

However, plants can tolerate herbivory by increasing seed production or seed quality. We used the monocarpic perennial Prenanthes roanensis to examine tolerance to mammalian herbivory through seed quality and modeled the effects of tolerance on population growth rate. METHODS: We examined seed quality (proportion of viable seeds, seed mass, germination, and seedling size) on damaged and undamaged plants to determine the extent to which plants tolerate herbivory. We then varied seed quality parameters over a range of values in population models to compare population growth rates under no-tolerance conditions (herbivory, but no tolerance) to those under tolerance conditions. KEY RESULTS: In most populations, plants damaged by herbivores had a greater proportion of viable seeds per plant or a greater probability of seed germination. Incorporating observed tolerance into population models did not significantly increase population growth rate. However, at low germination rates, increased germination of seeds from damaged plants has the potential to significantly increase population growth rate. CONCLUSIONS: Damaged plants can compensate for loss of reproductive heads by increasing seed viability and germination rates in the remaining seeds. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that tolerance through seed quality has the potential to affect population growth rate. Our results suggest that incorporating tolerance into population models may help elucidate mechanisms by which plant populations persist despite herbivory.  2015 Botanical Society of America.",4,2

Parameters considered in this study were discoloration, yellowing and fresh weight. Both discoloration and yellowing were measured, recorded according to 1-5 scale and their results ranged from 1-3.5, while fresh weight ranged from 33.1-76.5 g for treatments compared with 41.0-98.8 g for controls. Nine out of 21 studied tomato accessions were significantly different from other accessions and appeared to be resistant to the fungus under experimental conditions according to the 1-5 scale. Most of the resistant accessions were from the slow growing lines, while most of the fast growing accessions were susceptible. The study concluded that resistant accessions are promising ones to be used as root stocks for cultivated tomato varieties. 2012 Academic Journals Inc.",5,1

We examine the effects of land use on the diversity and spatial distribution of plants in five semi-arid communities of eastern Spain using non-linear methods to assess the spatialtemporal dynamics of plant populations. Specifically, we are interested in detecting long-term structural changes or drift in an ecosystem before it is too late to prevent irreversible degradation. Fractal analysis is used to characterize the complexity of plant spatial patterns and Information Theory indices are used to measure change in information flow with land use changes and soil substrate. We found that grazing favored diversity and heterogeneity of species distribution on the impoverished gypsum and saline substrate community, as opposed to the detrimental effect of grazing in the Alpha steppe community. Indeed, old-field succession after 30 years of abandonment showed a recovery of species diversity but not the spatial structure of the vegetation. Further, Information Fractal Dimension, representing the unpredictability of plant spatial patterns in the landscape, increased as we moved from a highly diverse to a less diverse community, revealing the change to a more scattered and homogeneous spatial plant distribution. The Information Fractal Dimension is a good estimator of ecosystem disturbance, independent of scale, and thus can be used to monitor ecosystem dynamics.  Springer 2005.",6,2

Besides their direct effects, herbivores may also have profound positive or negative indirect effects that can be modulated by nutrients and time. The interactive relationships between time, nutrient availability and herbivore impacts (direct and indirect) on plant growth dynamics are an emerging research topic that merits further effort. Here we did several experiments in a SW Atlantic marsh to contribute towards that gap by focusing on the dominant plant, Spartina densiflora, and one of the dominant herbivores, the crab Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata, in the marsh. Herbivory by the crab was highly seasonal, with most of the consumption occurring in fall. Even though crabs preferred nutrient enriched leaves, nitrogen content was not the driver of these seasonal variations. Crab herbivory had markedly indirect negative impacts on S. densiflora leaves, reducing their growth rates and increasing their senescence. These deleterious impacts may partially explain the seasonal decline in leaf growth and a net loss in leaf biomass observed in the fall. Fertilization did not seem to alter these processes. Adding nutrients increased leaf growth in the spring, where ambient herbivory was low, but it also increased herbivory in the fall, resulting in similar patterns as the ones observed under non-fertilized conditions. Herbivory by the crab also greatly affected the dynamics of S. densiflora stems. Increases in stem density in relation to initial conditions were larger in non-grazed than in grazed plots regardless of whether nutrients were added or not. Together, these results indicate that, in Southwestern marshes populated by S. densiflora and N. granulata, herbivory by the crab represents an important direct and indirect control of plant growth. Our results also emphasize the importance of considering impacts on growth rates and not only on biomass because not considering reduced growth after herbivory may lead to improper calculations of nutrient cycling or detritus production.  2011 Elsevier B.V.",7,2

It has been assumed that plants growing in high resource conditions are the ones best able to compensate for herbivory. However, just the opposite has been found for dicotyledonous plants exhibiting patterns of overcompensation, with most occurring in resource-poor conditions. Long-term studies of the monocarpic biennial, scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata growing in resource-poor conditions have shown that ungulate herbivory by mule deer and elk can result in a threefold increase in plant fitness over uneaten controls. These observations led us to hypothesize that fungal associations would facilitate the compensatory response most commonly observed in this Arizona population of scarlet gilia; perhaps mutualistic associations with fungi, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, would explain the phenomenon of overcompensation altogether. Fungal removal experiments, using Captan, a commercially available fungicide, showed that a reduction in fungal abundance altered the compensatory response following ungulate herbivory, particularly in years in which water was limited, increasing fitness compensation from equal compensation to overcompensation. A multifactorial experiment revealed that the interactive effects of water and fungicide maximized fruit production following herbivory. Our results are counter to the modification of tolerance hypothesis in which plants associating with mycorrhizal fungi will have higher tolerance to herbivory. It is likely that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes compete with plants for photosynthates following herbivory, thereby limiting the magnitude of compensation. Thus, fungi appear to be parasitic on scarlet gilia following ungulate herbivory.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",8,2

In this paper, we assessed the disturbance patterns and evaluated their effects on the population structure of Afzelia africana, in two different bioclimatic zones of the Republic of Benin. The main disturbances in the studied area included branch pruning and debarking. Individuals of medium size (2040 cm) were mostly pruned and debarked. The percentages of pruning and debarking were similar at population level across the two studied bioclimatic zones (t = 0.04, p = 0.96; t = 0.73, p = 0.48). Examining this at individual level, pruning was similar but debarking was higher in the Sudanian zone (12.14  0.93%) than in the Sudano-Guinean zone (7.44  0.88) (W = 40859, p < 0.001). Population structure was bell-shaped in the Sudanian zone regardless of the disturbance level. In contrast, in the Sudano-Guinean zone, mildly disturbed populations showed an inverse J-shaped structure, whereas those highly disturbed were bell-shaped. This underlined the climatic (dryness) and disturbance effects on the establishment and recruitment of small trees into the next life stage in tropical savanna ecosystems. Good regeneration pattern and the largest individuals were found within the protected areas, demonstrating the prominent role of protected areas for the species conservation. Therefore, we suggested that conservation efforts should be extended to populations outside the protected areas. Forestry department should establish firebreaks networks to protect small individuals and facilitate their recruitment, as well as the regulation and enforcement should be improved on the sustainable use of the species.  2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.",9,2

A problem is parasite adaptation via Avirulence (Avr) mutations, which allows the parasite to colonize the R gene plant. Scientists hope to make R genes more durable by stacking them in a single cultivar. However, stacking assumes that R gene-mediated resistance has no fitness cost for the plant. We tested this assumption for wheat's resistance to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Our study included ten plant fitness measures and four wheat genotypes, one susceptible, and three expressing either the H6, H9, or H13 resistance gene. Because R gene-mediated resistance has two components, we measured two types of costs: the cost of the constitutively- expressed H gene, which functions in plant surveillance, and the cost of the downstream induced responses, which were triggered by Hessian fly larvae rather than a chemical elicitor. For the constitutively expressed H gene, some measures indicated costs, but a greater number of measures indicated benefits of simply expressing the H gene. For the induced resistance, instead of costs, resistant plants showed benefits of being attacked. Resistant plants were more likely to survive attack than susceptible plants, and surviving resistant plants produced higher yield and quality. We discuss why resistance to the Hessian fly has little or no cost and propose that tolerance is important, with compensatory growth occurring after H gene-mediated resistance kills the larva. We end with a caution: Given that plants were given good growing conditions, fitness costs may be found under conditions of greater biotic or abiotic stress.  2011 Entomological Society of America.",10,2

Here, we examine the impact of feeding damage caused by different densities of the redlegged earth mite (Halotydeus destructor Tucker) on the performance and recovery of canola and wheat seedlings at different plant developmental stages, and when grown under three levels of moisture stress. Both canola and wheat were susceptible to feeding damage caused by H. destructor at early growth development stages (canola - cotyledon, first and second true leaf stage; wheat - GS10 and GS12), but tolerated damage at the later growth stages (canola - third true leaf stage; wheat - GS14). Wheat plants compensated completely for mite feeding damage, while canola plants showed partial compensation when feeding occurred at the cotyledon and first true leaf stages. Canola was susceptible to immediate feeding damage from H. destructor under all levels of moisture stress and did not compensate for this damage over time when grown in the unstressed and moderately stressed treatments. Under severe moisture stress conditions, plant performance traits and mite density often showed a nonlinear relationship, with growth initially increasing as mite density increased, but then decreasing markedly as densities exceeded 30 mites/100 cm2. Wheat seedlings were susceptible to immediate feeding damage when grown in the unstressed and severe stress conditions, but were generally able to compensate for this damage regardless of moisture conditions.

The role of herbivores in plant invasion has been investigated in relation to plant native/introduced status, however, a knowledge gap exists about whether food selection occurs according to native/introduced status or to species. We tested preference of the native herbivore white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for widespread and frequently occurring invasive introduced and native plants in the northeastern United States. Multiple-choice deer preference trials were conducted for the species and relative preference was determined using biomass consumption and feeding behavior. While more native than introduced plant biomass was consumed overall, deer food selection varied strongly by plant species. Results show consistent deer avoidance of several invasive introduced plants (Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii, and Microstegium vimineum) and a native plant (Dennstaedtia punctilobula). Other invasive introduced plants (Celastrus orbiculatus, Ligustrum vulgare, and Lonicera morrowii) and a native plant (Acer rubrum) were highly preferred. These results provide evidence that herbivore impacts on plant invaders depend on plant species palatability. Consequently, herbivore selectivity likely plays an important role in the invasion process.

To explain these patterns, the compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH) predicts plants to compensate for defoliation when resources are abundant, whereas the growth rate hypothesis (GRH) makes the opposite claim of high herbivory tolerance under resource-poor conditions. The limiting resource model (LRM) tries to reconcile this dichotomy by incorporating the indirect effects of herbivores on plant resources and predicts that the potential for plant compensation is dependent upon whether, and how, herbivory influences limiting resources. Although extensively evaluated in laboratory monocultures, it remains uncertain whether these models can also explain the response of heterogeneous and multi-species natural plant communities to defoliation. Here we investigate community-wide plant response to defoliation and report data from a field experiment in the arid and primarily water-limited Trans-Himalayan grazing ecosystem in northern India involving clipping, irrigation and nutrient-feedback with herbivore dung. Without nutrient-feedback, plants compensated for defoliation in absence of irrigation but failed to compensate under irrigation. Whereas, in the presence of nutrient-feedback plants compensated for defoliation when irrigated. This divergent pattern is not consistent with the CCH and GRH, and is only partially explained by the LRM. Instead, these pluralistic results are consistent with the hypothesis that herbivory may alter the relative strengths of water and nutrient limitation since irrigation increased root:shoot ratio in absence of fertilization in unclipped plots, but not in the corresponding clipped plots. So, herbivory appears to increase relative strength of nutrient-limitation for plants that otherwise seem to be primarily water-limited. Extending the LRM framework to include herbivore-mediated transitions between water and nutrient-limitation may clarify the underlying mechanisms that modulate herbivory-tolerance under different environmental conditions.  2011 The Authors.",17,2

Despite the fact that there is consensus that the abundance of freshwater macrophytes is strongly influenced by the availability of resources for plant growth, the importance of top-down control by vertebrate consumers is debated, because field studies yield contrasting results. We hypothesized that these bottom-up and top-down forces may interact, and that consumer impact on macrophyte abundance depends on the nutrient status of the water body. To test this hypothesis, experimental ponds with submerged vegetation containing a mixture of species were subjected to a fertilization treatment and we introduced consumers (mallard ducks, for 8days) on half of the ponds in a full factorial design. Over the whole 66-day experiment fertilized ponds became dominated by Elodea nuttallii and ponds without extra nutrients by Chara globularis. Nutrient addition significantly increased plant N and P concentrations. There was a strong interactive effect of duck presence and pond nutrient status: macrophyte biomass was reduced (by 50%) after the presence of the ducks on fertilized ponds, but not in the unfertilized ponds. We conclude that nutrient availability interacts with top-down control of submerged vegetation. This may be explained by higher plant palatability at higher nutrient levels, either by a higher plant nutrient concentration or by a shift towards dominance of more palatable plant species, resulting in higher consumer pressure. Including nutrient availability may offer a framework to explain part of the contrasting field observations of consumer control of macrophyte abundance.  2014, The Author(s).",18,2

There are three models that predict contrasting compensatory growth responses of plants to herbivory and resource availability: (1) Growth rate model, (2) Compensatory continuum hypothesis and (3) Limiting resource model. The predictions of these three models were tested on the tree Brosimum alicastrum and the liana Vitis tiliifolia. Seedlings were subjected to three levels of experimental defoliation (0%, 50% and 90% leaf removal) along a light resource gradient (1%, 9% and 65% of full sun). In both species, defoliation significantly increased leaf production rate and relative growth rate of leaf area, but not of biomass. Net assimilation rate was the strongest driver of biomass growth in both species, but leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were also important in B. alicastrum. Compensatory responses of leaf area growth in B. alicastrum were significantly greater in higher than lower light availability, consistent with the compensatory continuum hypothesis predictions, but in contrast to the growth rate model predictions. The limiting resource model offered an explanation for all possible experimental outcomes by directly considering the effects of environmental differences in resource availability.

Recent research demonstrates linkages between species distributions along rainfall gradients and physiological drought tolerance; corresponding experimental examinations of the contribution of pest pressure to distributional limits and potential interactions between drought and herbivory are limited. This study aims to quantitate differential performance and herbivory as a function of species range limits across a climatic and floristic transition in Southeast Asia. Khao Chong Botanical Garden, Thailand and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia straddle the Kangar-Pattani Line. A reciprocal transplantation across a seasonality gradient was established using two groups of species (""widespread"" taxa whose distributions include seasonally dry forests and ""aseasonal"" taxa whose distributions are limited to aseasonal forests). Growth, biomass allocation, survival, and herbivory were monitored for 19 months. Systematic differences in performance were a function of species distribution in relation to rainfall seasonality. In aseasonal Pasoh, aseasonal species had both greater growth and survivorship than widespread species. These differences were not a function of differential herbivory as widespread and aseasonal species experienced similar damage in the aseasonal forest. In seasonally dry Khao Chong, widespread species showed higher survivorship than aseasonal species, but these differences were only apparent during drought. We link this differential performance to physiological mechanisms as well as differential tolerance of biotic pressure during drought stress. Systematic decreases in seedling survival in aseasonal taxa during drought corresponded with previously documented physiological differences and may be exacerbated by herbivore damage. These results have important implications for tropical diversity and community composition in light of predicted increases in the frequency and severity of drought in hyperdiverse tropical forests.  2012 The Authors.

Amphibian population losses have been more severe than those of birds and mammals. Amphibian population declines are likely due to many factors including habitat loss, disease, contaminants, introduced species and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. The effect of UVB, however, varies widely among species and can vary within populations of the same species or at different life-history stages. This variation has often led to opposing conclusions about how UVB affects amphibians. We used meta-analysis techniques to explore the overall effects of UVB radiation on survival in amphibians. We also used recently developed factorial meta-analytic techniques to quantify potential interactions between UVB radiation and other stressors on amphibians. Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by 1.9-fold compared with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible to damage from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental stressors and resulted in greater than additive effects on survival when 2 stressors were present. Our results suggest that UVB radiation is an important stressor in amphibians, particularly in light of potential synergisms between UVB and other stressors in amphibian habitats.  2008 Society for Conservation Biology.",21,2

Theoretical models come to different conclusions about the effects of inorganic soil nutrient levels on tolerance to AMD, and different plants have shown different relationships between these variables. To assign some order to these disparate patterns and to resolve conflicts among the models, the 'limiting resources model' (LRM) was developed. However, we believe that the LRM is actually comprised of several different models, which we describe. Our study marks the first comprehensive and simultaneous test of the entire LRM framework, treating it explicitly as separate models, which also evaluates the models' underlying assumptions. We studied tolerance to AMD in laboratory-reared natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from three different regions of Europe, spanning a wide latitudinal gradient. We show that, in different populations of this species, basic responses to nutrients and damage are best described by different models, which are based on different assumptions and make different predictions. This demonstrates the need for complexity in our explanations, and suggests that no one existing model can account for all relationships between tolerance to AMD and nutrients.

We evaluated the responses to browsing (simulated by mechanical clipping of 50% of current-year shoots) of saplings from 2 deciduous (Acer opalus ssp. granatense and Quercus pyrenaica) and 2 evergreen (Quercus ilex and Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii) late-successional tree species, measuring an array of morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits.

Clipping affected biomass distribution, growth, and sapling size, while only slight physiological and biochemical effects were detected. Species characteristics and the light environment in which saplings grow determine their capacity to recover biomass lost after herbivore damage.

Dinosaur faunas changed markedly during the Mesozoic, from early faunas dominated by taxa with simple, uniform feeding mechanics to Cretaceous biomes including diverse sophisticated sympatric herbivores; the environmental and biological drivers causing these changes remain unclear. Isotopic, taphonomic, and anatomical evidence implies that niche partitioning reduced competition between sympatric herbivores, via morphological differentiation, dietary preferences, and habitat selection.

Artificial defoliation was applied at 3 and 9 months of age to remove 40 and 55% of leaf area in the upper crown, respectively. At 18 months of age, height, stem diameter and leaf area were not significantly different between control and defoliated saplings, across all resource treatments. However, stem volume, bark volume and branch number were significantly increased in defoliated saplings, including a significant interaction with resource treatment. Total above-ground biomass of saplings in response to defoliation was significantly higher (almost double) than controls for the low water (N+W-) treatment only. Significantly increased foliar starch content (and a trend for increased soluble sugars) in the upper crown zone was found in the defoliated saplings of the N + W-treatment compared with the upper zone of control saplings.

Defoliation and shoot removal reduce the photosynthetic capacity of plants and are also thought to reduce allocation of carbon to roots and mycorrhizal fungi. However, evidence supporting this assumption remains equivocal.2. ducted a meta-analysis of 99 experiments, from 33 publications, measuring arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal colonization of roots after real or simulated herbivory removed leaves or shoots. We also explored how effects were moderated by the type of mycorrhiza, fertilization, experimental setting (laboratory or field), treatment (real herbivory of shoots, real herbivory of leaves, simulated herbivory of shoots, simulated herbivory of leaves), type of host plant, duration of the experiment and year of publication.3. Overall, herbivory reduced mycorrhizal colonization by about 3 percentage points. Treatment, host plant type and year of publication were the only significant moderators, with real or simulated herbivory of leaves and real herbivory of shoots suppressing colonization, while simulated removal of shoots tended to increase colonization. Herbivory reduced colonization of perennial grasses and deciduous trees by about 4 and 8 percentage points, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of annual crops was reduced by about 12 percentage points, although this was not significantly different from zero. Mycorrhizal colonization of perennial forbs and evergreen trees was also unaffected by herbivory, and colonization of mixtures of perennial grasses and forbs increased by about 15 percentage points following herbivory. Effect size increased with year of publication, likely due to shifts in experimental designs towards systems more likely to show positive effects of herbivory on mycorrhiza.4. Synthesis. Our results challenge the carbon-limitation hypothesis and suggest that herbivory, real or simulated, reduces mycorrhizal colonization by biologically meaningful amounts only in a limited subset of systems.  2010 The Authors.

Although biotic resistance and disturbance are often considered separately in the invasion literature, these two forces may be linked. One mechanism by which disturbance may facilitate biological invasions is by decreasing the effectiveness of biotic resistance. The effects of both disturbance and biotic resistance may vary across invading genotypes, and genetic variation in the invasive propagule pool may increase the likelihood that some genotypes can overcome biotic resistance or take greater advantage of disturbance. We conducted an experimental field trial in which we manipulated soil disturbance (thatch removal and loosening soil) and the presence of insect herbivores and examined their effects on the invasion success of 44 Medicago polymorpha genotypes. As expected, insecticide reduced leaf damage and increased Medicago fecundity, suggesting that insect herbivores in this system provide some biotic resistance. Soil disturbance increased Medicago fecundity, but did not alter the effectiveness of biotic resistance by insect herbivores. We found significant genetic variation in Medicago in response to disturbance, but not in response to insect herbivores. These results suggest that the ability of Medicago to invade particular habitats depends on the amount of insect herbivory, the history of disturbance in the habitat, and how the specific genotypes in the invader pool respond to these factors.  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",29,2

A prominent idea in the literature on plant-herbivore interactions is that fast-growing species have low resistance but high resilience to herbivory. In other words, fast-growing species are selectively eaten by herbivores but recover quickly following damage. Many studies have challenged the generality of this theory, but little attention has been paid to plant species that have evolved in the absence of major groups of herbivores. Here we analyse whether this resistance-resilience trade-off applies to New Zealand woody species, which evolved without exposure to mammalian herbivores until their introduction in 19th century. 2. We simulated deer browse by clipping saplings of 12 tree species to varying extents (0, 20, 40, 80 and 100% of leaf-bearing branches removed), and quantified the shoot growth, diameter growth and survival of these saplings. The time taken to regrow the removed branches was generally slow, but varied among species. For example, species took between 0.5 and 3 years to recover from removal of 60% of branches. It was the inherently fast-growing species that recovered most quickly. Some species had stimulated shoot growth at moderate levels of clipping (40-60%) but this effect had relatively little effect on recovery time compared with differences in potential growth rates of species. 3. Diameter growth rate fell linearly with increased clipping intensity for all 12 species, and there was no indication of recovery 2 years after the treatment. We speculate that saplings invested in rebuilding their canopies following clipping, and that few resources were left over for diameter growth. 4. Few saplings died as a result of clipping, except when 100% of leaf-bearing shoots were removed, in which case five species died in substantial numbers (> 15%), including all three conifers in the study. 5. Previous work has shown that the most palatable species (i.e. those with low resistance) have leaves with low fibre content. We find that these species are relatively fast growing and recover most rapidly from simulated browsing (i.e. are highly resilient). This provides some support for a resistance-resilience trade-off related to potential growth rates. 6. Deer invasion in New Zealand was associated with the loss of short soft-leaved tree species from the browse layer. Our study suggests that the most palatable species have the potential to grow fast and may be in a relatively strong position to recover if deer are eradicated.  2007 The Authors.",30,2

As a result, few invaders are free of herbivore damage; however, the incidence of this herbivory and its consequences for plant demography may depend on an array of biotic and abiotic factors. In Alliaria petiolata, a non-native invasive forb in Canada, we quantified the incidence of leaf herbivory, rosette survival and seed production along with conspecific plant density and environmental site conditions in wild populations in mesic forest understory and moist grasslands. We complemented the field survey by a laboratory experiment with Trichoplusia to test whether the palatability of leaf tissue of A. petiolata varies with plant life stage and habitat type. Incidence of herbivory was significantly higher in adults than in rosettes, and significantly higher in grasslands than in forest understory. The palatability experiment confirmed that leaves of adults were more palatable to a generalist herbivore than leaves of rosettes. Path analysis revealed negative plant density-dependent herbivory of adults in forest understory but positive density-dependent herbivory in grasslands. Incidence of herbivory in rosettes was positively associated with soil moisture in grasslands, but not in forest understory. Seed production was significantly positively associated with herbivory in adults and soil moisture, whereas rosette survival was significantly negatively associated with conspecific plant density. We conclude that the patterns, determinants and demographic consequences of herbivory in invasive Alliaria may strongly depend on a plants life stage and plant density and may further be confounded by landscape heterogeneity.  2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",33,2

We conducted a common garden experiment with 12 populations of two ploidy levels of the perennial herb Cardaminepratensis (five populations of tetraploid ssp. pratensis and seven populations of octoploid ssp. paludosa). Earlier studies have shown that attack rates by the main herbivore, the orange tip butterfly Anthocharis cardamines, are lower in populations of octoploids than in populations of tetraploids, and vary among populations. In the common garden experiment, a combination of natural and artificial damage significantly reduced seed and flower production. We measured tolerance based on four plant-performance metrics: survival, growth, seed production and clonal reproduction. For three of these measurements, tolerance of damage did not differ between ploidy levels. For clonal reproduction, the octoploids had a higher tolerance than the tetraploids, although they experience lower herbivore attack rates in natural populations. Populations from sites with high levels of herbivory had higher tolerance, measured by seed production, than populations with low levels of herbivory. We did not detect any significant costs of tolerance.

In contrast, while plants are increased by fertilization, this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in either the presence or absence of predators.

Here we quantify the independent and interactive effects of multiple concurrent changes to resources and consumers in an invaded annual grassland community in California. In a two-year study using thirty-seven 400-m2 plots, we examine interactions among four nutrient treatments (N, P, K and micronutrients) and a keystone herbivore (pocket gopher Thomomys bottae) on four plant community outcomes: 1) plant diversity, 2) functional group composition, 3) net biomass production, an important ecosystem function, and 4) infection risk by a group of viral pathogens shared by crop and non-crop grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses), an important regulating ecosystem service. We found that grassland biodiversity and infection risk were controlled by nutrient identity and supply ratio whereas nutrients interacted strongly with consumers to control grassland composition and net primary productivity. The most important insights arising from this multi-factor experiment are that net biomass production increased with phosphorus or nitrogen supply; however, when gophers were present, nitrogen caused no net effect on biomass production. In addition, infection risk was driven by phosphorus, nitrogen and micronutrient supply. Infection in a sentinel host increased strongly with the addition of micronutrients or phosphorus; however, infection declined with increasing N/P supply ratio, indicating stoichiometric control of infection risk. Finally, in spite of manipulating multiple factors, plant species richness declined with nitrogen, alone. The importance of higher-order interactions demonstrates that a multi-factor approach is critical for effective predictions in a world in which anthropogenic activities are simultaneously changing herbivore abundance and the relative supply of many nutrients.  2013 The Authors.",38,2

The study was repeated in a drier upland and mesic lowland range site. Yield was assessed as annual accumulated herbage production and, for HILF and control treatments in 2012 (year 3), evaluated separately for forbs and major graminoids. Temporal changes in the proportional yield during the growing season were also examined for the HILF and HIHF treatments. Moisture addition increased accumulated herbage, especially in the upland, and exacerbated differences among defoliation effects in select years. Productivity was greatest in the deferred controls, suggesting no treatment led to overcompensation, even with moisture addition. Among growing season treatments, yields under HILF exceeded that of the HIHF in 6 of 10 different combinations of site and year, particularly early in the study and under high moisture. Observed herbage yields suggest deferred patches of grassland may boost productivity and limit the ability of HILF defoliation to increase production, a pattern magnified by a reduction in Pascopyrum smithii in lowlands before mid-July. Accumulated herbage yield did respond favorably to HILF defoliation in uplands due to increased yields of Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths. Overall, these results suggest that any growing season defoliation reduces yields, although where defoliation is necessary at that time, production may be more likely to be maintained under HILF defoliation. More studies examining long-term growth responses to defoliation that include variation in vegetation types, environmental conditions, and defoliation regime are warranted.

The impacts of insect biological control agents on the invasive aquatic weed, water hyacinth ( Eichhornia crassipes) vary with nutrient levels in the environment. It was therefore considered important to evaluate nutrient-specific responses of E. crassipes to a grasshopper herbivore, Cornops aquaticum, prior to its release in South Africa. Both plant productivity and the response of E. crassipes to herbivory by C. aquaticum were nutrient dependent. Increases in plant biomass and leaf and ramet production were correlated with increases in nutrients in the water and plant biomass accumulation was reduced by herbivory at all three nutrient levels tested (high. = 67%; medium. = 100%; low. = 400%). C. aquaticum nymphs fed E. crassipes leaves with the lowest nitrogen levels produced the highest biomass of frass during their development, indicating compensatory consumption. The results suggest that environmental nutrient availability will influence efficacy of C. aquaticum. They also provide further evidence that E. crassipes problems are exacerbated by an over-abundance of nutrients in aquatic environments, and that biological control would be a highly effective management tool if aquatic systems in South Africa were less polluted. Additionally, the results also show how an understanding of the fundamental responses of E. crassipes and its insect biocontrol agents to their environment can assist in determining specific management strategies or interventions according to prevailing site-specific conditions.  2013 Elsevier Inc.",42,2

Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway, possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world. The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators, large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem productivity in high-density districts.",43,2

Although many plants can compensate for herbivore damage, and some even overcompensate, we cannot yet generalize about the conditions that promote a positive response to damage. Here, we asked how abiotic resources (i.e. plant nutrient status) coupled with biotic interactions - i.e. subsequent interactions with pollinators, seed predators and nectar robbing bumble bees - affect the compensatory ability of Ipomopsis aggregata, a monocarpic herb that has been the subject of much previous debate. We hypothesized that compensation to herbivore damage in I. aggregata (Polemoniaceae) would depend first on plants having an ample supply of resources and, second, on the outcome of subsequent interactions with mutualist pollinators and enemy pre-dispersal seed predators and nectar robbing bumble bees. We used a fully-factorial experiment in which plants were watered, fertilized or left as unmanipulated controls, crossed with clipping to simulate herbivore damage to the apical meristem. Resource addition enhanced both male and female components of fitness, but resource enhancement did not provide the means for plants to fully compensate for simulated herbivory. Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences, but at the expense of a delay in flowering and fewer total flowers. Clipping significantly reduced losses to dipteran pre-dispersal seed predators by delaying flowering time, but early flowering plants produced higher numbers of seeds despite incurring higher rates of predation. Clipped plants incurred a higher risk to nectar robbers in one of two years. Overall, clipped plants suffered severe reductions (a nearly 50% reduction in total seed set) in female success, but clipping combined with nutrient addition enhanced male function through increases in per-flower pollen production. However, because clipped plants produced significantly fewer flowers than unclipped plants, whole-plant pollen production was significantly reduced by clipping. Pollinator visitation and nectar robbing were variable between clipping treatments and between years and (nectar robbing) among sites. Our results demonstrate that the variability in plant response to herbivory can, at least in part, be driven by plant interactions with mutualists and enemies. Thus, accounting for such interactions and their variability is important to fully understanding plant compensation for herbivore damage and will likely go far to explain variation in plant response that appears to be independent of resources.  2012 The Authors.",44,2

Here, I combine plant defence theory with functional approaches to quantify genetic trait variation and phenotypic trait plasticity of nine goldenrod (Solidago altissima) genotypes derived from a local field population in Connecticut, USA, to herbivory along a nutrient supply gradient. I found that increasing nutrient supply changed the dominant plant defence strategy from tolerance to induced resistance. Induced resistance was detected through decreased herbivore growth rates and a behavioural feeding shift of grasshoppers to older leaf tissue. This could not be fully accounted for through stoichiometric changes in leaf tissue quality. A multidimensional phenotype approach revealed that abiotic and biotic environments (nutrients and herbivory) accounted for almost as much whole-plant trait variation (31%) as did plant genotype (36%). Increasing nutrient supply and herbivory resulted in independent and differential effects on whole-plant trait expression. Increasing both treatments concurrently produced a unique plant phenotype with increased leaf carbon content and allocation to asexual reproduction (EE). Notably, individual genotypes exhibited different magnitudes of multivariate trait plasticity to nutrient and herbivory gradients. However, the population of genotypes as a whole within a given environment expressed an approximately equal magnitude of trait variation across both permissive (high nutrient, no herbivory) and stressful (low nutrient, high herbivory) environments. Quantifying plasticity in defensive strategy in concert with correlated whole-plant trait expression changes across multiple abiotic and biotic factors may be key to providing a mechanistic understanding of how heterogeneous landscapes impact community interactions and ecosystem processes.

The physiological basis of this difference is examined here in a comparative study of two ecotypes that differ in tolerance andmaximum growth rate, using a growth analytical approach. One hundred and fifty-four plants of each ecotype grown under controlled conditions were suddenly defoliated (35 % of total leaf area removed) and a similar sample size of plants remained undefoliated (control). Ontogenetic plastic changes in RGR and its growth components [net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area and leaf weight ratio (LWR)] after defoliation were measured to determine whether these plastic changes maximize plant growth and fitness. Different ontogenetic phases of the response were discerned and increased RGR of defoliated plants was detected at the end of the experimental period, but brought about by a different growth component (NAR or LWR) in each ecotype. These changes in RGR are putatively related to increases in fitness in defoliated environments. At the intra-specific scale, data showed a trade-off between the ability to grow under benign environmental conditions and the ability to tolerate resource limitation due to defoliation.

Most studies on the effects of herbivory in trees rely on correlational inter-individual comparisons and could, thus, be affected by confounding factors linked to both herbivory and plant performance. Using the Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) as a study model, we followed an experimental approach in which leaf-feeding insects (mainly Lepidoptera caterpillars) were excluded from some shoots in all study trees. Shoots subjected to herbivore exclusion exhibited lower defoliation rates and produced more acorns than control shoots. Defoliation constrained shoot growth throughout the study period, but had no effect on the number of female flowers produced per shoot. Acorn production was, however, lower in control shoots due to their higher abortion rates, and also to their greater mortality risk during summer drought, as shoots with fewer leaves were less likely to survive. Plant reaction to herbivory inhibits certain physiological pathways involved in plant growth, which, together with the effects of physical damage, reduces the amount and efficiency of the photosynthetic tissue. This increases their vulnerability to environmental stresses, such as water deficit, which limit resource assimilation. Defoliation is likely a key factor affecting oak regeneration, as it may be a significant source of seed loss prior to pre-dispersal acorn predation. Further experimental studies could help to elucidate its effects in contrasting environments. In Mediterranean regions, the harsher droughts predicted by climate change models could worsen the effects of insect herbivory on oak reproductive output.  2017 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",48,2

Defoliation experiments were conducted in three natural A. schlechtendalii populations in Mexico: coastal sand dunes (Telchac); thorny dry forest (Dzemul); and medium-height subhumid forest (Hobonil). Experiments were also conducted under common-garden conditions using plants transplanted from the three populations. 3. Logistic regression models showed that herbivory did not affect growth negatively, but did affect floral display in A. schlechtendalii. The effect on floral display differed as a function of environment, damage intensity and season. When the plants experienced no resource limitation (common garden), herbivory inhibited inflorescence production in the first season (2001) and at the highest damage level (75%). When plants experienced heterogeneous resource conditions (field experiment), inflorescence production was inhibited in the second season (2002) at intermediate damage intensities. 4.

This may predictably depend on whether herbivory occurs above or below ground and on relative plant competitive ability. We simulated the potential impact of above-or belowground damage by biocontrol agents on the growth of a woody invader (Chinese tallow tree, Triadica sebifera) through artificial herbivory, with or without competition with a native grass, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). We measured two defense responses of Triadica through quantifying constitutive and induced extrafloral nectar production and tolerance of above-and belowground damage (root and shoot biomass regrowth). We examined genetic variation in plant growth and defense across native (China) and invasive (United States) Triadica populations. Without competition, aboveground damage had a greater impact than belowground damage on Triadica performance, whereas with competition and above-and belowground damage impacted Triadica similarly. Whole plant tolerance to damage below ground was negatively associated with tolerance to grass competitors indicating tradeoffs in the ability to tolerate herbivory vs. compete. Competition reduced investment in defensive extrafloral nectar (EFN) production. Aboveground damage inhibited rather than induced EFN production while belowground plant damage did not impact aboveground nectar production. We found some support for the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis for invasive plants as United States plants were larger than native China plants and were more plastic in their response to biotic stressors than China plants (they altered their root to shoot ratios dependent on herbivory and competition treatments). Our results indicate that habitat type and the presence of competitors may be a larger determinant of herbivory impact than feeding mode and suggest that integrated pest management strategies including competitive dynamics of recipient communities should be incorporated into biological control agent evaluation at earlier stages.  2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",50,2

Shrubs can tolerate browsing and their level of tolerance could be affected by browsing and soils productivity, eventually modifying resource availability for the caribou. Our objective was to assess the compensatory growth potential of a subarctic shrub, Betula glandulosa Michx., in relation with caribou browsing and nutriment availability for the plants. We used a simulated browsing (0, 25 and 75% of available shoots) and nitrogen-fertilisation (0 and 10 g m-2) experiment to test two main hypotheses linking tolerance to resource availability, the Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis and the Growth Rate Hypothesis as well as the predictions from the Limiting Resource Model. We seek to explicitly integrate the relative browsing pressure in our predictions since the amount of tissues removed could affect the capacity of long-lived plants to compensate. Birches fully compensated for moderate browsing with an overall leaf biomass similar to unbrowsed birches but undercompensated under heavy browsing pressure. The main mechanism explaining compensation appears to be the conversion of short shoots into long shoots. The leaf area increased under heavy browsing pressure but only led to undercompensation. Fertilisation for two consecutive years did not influence the response of birch, thus we conclude that our results support the LRM hypothesis of equal tolerance under both high and low nitrogen availability. Our results highlight that the potential for compensatory growth in dwarf birch is surpassed under heavy browsing pressure independently of the fertilisation regime. In the context of the worldwide decline in caribou herds, the reduction in browsing pressure could act synergistically with global climate change to promote the current shrub expansion reported in subarctic regions.  2012 Champagne et al.",51,2

Topics covered include effects of endophytes on host growth, physiology, reproduction, and competitive ability in both agronomically important forages such as tall fescue and perennial ryegrass and in native grasses. Also, endophyte-host interactions are explored in relation to abiotic (e.g., drought) and biotic stresses (e.g., herbivory).

Hypothesis: Tolerance to leaf damage should be lower under light limitation (shade) than under full sunlight, because a reduction in leaf area and less exposure to light will limit carbon photo-Assimilation and plants' ability to maintain fitness. Organism: Jimsonweed, Datura stramonium L. (Solanaceae). Methods: Damaged and undamaged plants of ten full-sib families (N 471 plants) were grown under two different light treatments, full sunlight (control) and 35% light reduction (shade). Total seed number produced per plant was used as an estimate of maternal plant fitness. To compare the effect of light reduction on tolerance, we used the index of tolerance (the difference in seed production between the damaged and undamaged treatment of each genetic family). We also evaluated the effect of defoliation and light limitation on photosynthetic activity (estimated as the chlorophyll content index) and leaf growth compensation (i.e. total leaf area, mean area per leaf, and leaf number), compensatory characters related to tolerance. Conclusions: Light limitation exacerbates the negative effect of leaf damage on plant fitness, producing a two-fold average reduction in tolerance.

Evidence suggests that horse populations are growing by 15 to 20 percent each year, a level that is unsustainable for maintaining healthy horse populations as well as healthy ecosystems. Promising fertility-control methods are available to help limit this population growth, however. In addition, science-based methods exist for improving population estimates, predicting the effects of management practices in order to maintain genetically diverse, healthy populations, and estimating the productivity of rangelands.

In particular, the effects of grazing on plant traits may translate into altered litter quality, with potentially important consequences for litter-feeding decomposers. Plant and litter variability in response to grazing is expected to depend on soil fertility levels, with tolerance and defensive strategies more commonly expressed on fertile and poorer soils, respectively. However, how grazing and fertility interactively alter litter quality and palatability to detritivores has not been explored yet. We conducted a cafeteria experiment with three common millipede (Diplopoda) species feeding on leaf litter from two plant species, the grass Bromopsis erecta and the forb Potentilla verna. Each millipede was offered a binary choice between litter types produced by the same plant species, but sampled in plots with distinct herbivory and fertilization status: litter originating from grazed areas or from 1-year sheep exclosures, both in native areas and in adjacent paddocks that received chemical N and P fertilization, as well as litter from a 25-year sheep exclosures in the native area. We found that fertilization and herbivore exclusion interactively affected Bromopsis litter quality and palatability, whereas Potentilla was much less affected. Bromopsis litter palatability was not affected by grazing when litter was collected in native plots, except for the long-term exclosure which led to low palatability. In contrast, and in line with our expectations, herbivory was associated with much higher palatability in fertilized plots. The changes in palatability were associated with important alterations of litter quality. Overall, our study demonstrates that intraspecific variation in litter can have profound consequences for soil functioning. It emphasizes the role of grazing as a key, but plant species-specific factor controlling litter intraspecific variability, and its complex interaction with soil fertility level. Moreover, our results advocate for a better understanding of the response of the different organisms involved in the decomposition process, in particular litter-feeding macro-detritivores. We encourage future studies aiming at disentangling the various and complex relationships between above-ground processes such as herbivory and soil functioning.  2018 The Authors.

The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist.

Biological control can suppress these introduced species, but without restoration another introduced species can invade. Integration of biological control with concurrent revegetation can both aid in weed reduction via interspecific plant competition and establish a restored native plant community. This 3-year study investigated an integrated approach to controlling the introduced annual Mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata [L.] H. Gross [Polygonaceae]) using the biocontrol weevil Rhinoncomimus latipes Korotyaev (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and restoration planting using a native seed mix. A fully factorial design tested weevils and seeding, separately and together, using insecticide to eliminate weevils. The weevils together with the native seed mix reduced P. perfoliata percent cover in 2009 and 2010, and peak seed cluster production in 2010, compared to the insecticide-no seed control treatment. Persicaria perfoliata final dry biomass was reduced by 75% in 2010 and by 57% in 2011 in the weevils plus seed treatment compared to the control, with weevils having the greatest effect in 2010 and the seed treatment having the greatest impact in 2011. Results suggest an additive effect of biocontrol and seeding in suppressing P. perfoliata. Seeded treatments also developed the highest native plant species richness and diversity, comprised of spontaneous recolonization in addition to species from the seed mix. Results support the use of integrated management of this invasive weed, with suppression through biological control and native revegetation together helping prevent reinvasion while restoring native plant biodiversity.  2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.",57,2

The principles of life-history theory suggest that this size reduction could evolve if the infection reduces predation pressure. Question: Does the endophyte protect grass seedlings against herbivory? Hypothesis: Herbivores consume more seedlings that develop from endophyte-free grass seeds than from endophyte-infected grass seeds. Organisms: Epichlo typhina is the seed-transmitted endophytic fungus, the weeping alkaligrass (Puccinellia distans) seedlings are the hosts, and the grove snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is the herbivore. Methods: Our experiment consisted of two 66-h food-choice tests. The tests were performed consecutively and on the same individual snails. We offered snails freshly harvested weeping alkaligrass seedlings with and without the endophyte. Results: Starved snails consumed approximately 20% less biomass of infected seedlings than uninfected seedlings. When the same snails were tested again shortly after their first contact with the endophyte, they exhibited an approximately 40% reduction in seedling consumption, and food discrimination became undetectable.

There was a negative correlation of family tolerance levels between competition treatments: plant families with high tolerance to apical damage in the low competition treatment had low tolerance to apical damage in the high competition treatment and vice versa. We found no costs of tolerance, in terms of a trade-off between tolerance to apical and leaf damage or between tolerance and competitive ability, or an allocation cost in terms of reduced fitness of highly tolerant families in the undamaged state.

Plant community development depends to a great extent on the availability of soil nutrients, but recent studies underline the role of symbiotic, herbivorous and pathogenic soil biota. We tested for interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors by studying the effects of additional nutrients and the removal of soil biota on the replacement of grassland plant species typical of different successional stages. 2. Species representing each of the early, mid and target phases of secondary succession in a grassland community (four per phase) were grown in mid-successional grassland soil. The mixed plant communities were grown in sterilized and non-sterilized soil, at three nutrient supply levels. The distribution of shoot biomass over the different plant species, and the total root biomass, were determined, as well as the composition of nematode and microarthropod communities and soil decomposition rates. 3. The effect of nutrient supply on plant community composition depended on soil sterilization. In sterilized soil, the plant community was initially dominated by grasses that increased in dominance even without fertilization. In non-sterilized soil, the plant community was more diverse and grass dominance decreased over time, except with high fertilization. Fertilization enhanced the productivity of the plant community in sterilized and, to a greater extent, in non-sterilized soil. 4. The abundance of root-feeding nematodes was positively related to increased root biomass, pointing to a strong bottom-up control. Increased levels of nutrient supply were associated with reduced abundance of omnivorous nematodes, the cause of this reduction being less clear. Increased soil fertility altered the functional diversity of the soil nematode community, which might, in the longer term, also affect their feedback effects on the plant community. 5. Increased nutrient supply reduced soil decomposition activity in the non-sterilized soil, but not in the sterilized soil. 6. Our results imply that soil biota may reduce the effects of nutrient supply on plant dominance. Incorporating the effects of soil biota on plant species interactions into studies on succession, plant species diversity and restoration may therefore considerably increase our understanding of the observed plant community patterns.",61,2

With common milkweed Asclepias syriaca (Asclepiadaceae) we conducted 27 experiments with insect herbivory or mechanical tissue removal to examine whether A. syriaca leaf Pn reductions were correlated with the occurrence of gross cardenolide induction and/or with reproductive phenology. Using spectrophotometry, positive cardenolide induction was detected in only one study when Pn impairment was detected with gas exchange data from injured A. syriaca leaves, while negative or no cardenolide induction was detected in the other five A. syriaca studies with Pn impairment. The occurrence of Pn impairment after partial leaf defoliation did have a seasonal pattern which correlated with A. syriaca reproductive phenology: little or no Pn impairment occurred on leaves of pre-flowering or maturing seed pod plants, while moderate to severe leaf Pn impairment occurred on leaves of flowering and early seed pod formation plants. Our results fail to support either constitutive cardenolide levels or gross cardenolide induction trade-offs to be reflected in injured leaf Pn impairment; however, our results could be explained by a resource or hormone trade-off between investment into reproduction with maintaining leaf photosynthesis after herbivory. Specifically, we suggest that a physiological 'cost of reproduction' is increased susceptibility to Pn impairment after herbivory injury on a leaf. Future studies will need to examine whether resource or hormonal regulation trade-offs cause this proposed physiological trade-off between reproduction and photosynthesis.  2009, American Midland Naturalist.",62,2

Indicators of seedling performance were aboveground and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB), root: shoot ratio, tillering, and mortality. The effect size statistic, Hedge's g, allowed for comparisons between performance measures. Water stress induced reductions inmost performance measures: BGB (g=ND: -1.3; D: -1.6), root: shoot ratio (g=ND: n. s.; D: -0.2), and tillering (g=ND: -1.7; D: -1.2), though not significantly for all species. For ABG, water stress interacted with defoliation, reducing performance less at an intensity of 70\% (g = -2.0) as opposed to 30\% (g = -3.0), but not always significantly in the former. Water stress also caused less reduction in AGB when no defoliation occurred (ND: -0.8; g=D: -2.5). Intensity and frequency of defoliation interacted; seedlings were generally resistant to reductions in performance except at high frequency, 70\% defoliation. Agropyron cristatum and P. spicata displayed similar sensitivity to treatments, mostly in terms of changes in AGB and BGB, while P. secunda also experienced increased mortality and reduced tillering.

Although Dioscorea praehensilis, a wild yam of African forests, is perennial, both aerial apparatus and tuber are annually renewed. Each year, the tuber produces a single stem that climbs from the ground to the forest canopy. This stem bears no leaves and no branches until it reaches optimal light conditions. Once in the canopy, the plant's production fuels the filling of a new tuber before the plant dies back to the ground. We hypothesized that if deprived of ant defense, the leafless growth phase is a vulnerable part of the cycle, during which a small amount of herbivory entails a high cost in terms of loss of opportunity. We compared the growth of stems bearing ants or not as well as of intact stems and stems subjected to simulated or natural herbivory. Ants reduce herbivory; herbivory delays arrival to the canopy and shortens the season of production. Artificially prolonging the stem growth to the canopy increased plant mortality in the following year and, in surviving plants, reduced the stem diameter and likely the underground reserves produced. Tuber size is a key variable in plant performance as it affects both the size of the aerial apparatus and the duration of its single season of production. Aerial apparatus and tuber are thus locked into a cycle of reciprocal annual renewal. Costs due to loss of opportunity may play a major role in plant tolerance to herbivory, especially when architectural constraints interact with ecological conditions to shape the plant's growth strategy.  2017 The Authors.

We combined observational data and a field experiment to test whether an ambush predator - the puma (Puma concolor) - affected the antipredator behavior of its primary ungulate prey - the vicua (Vicugna vicugna) - which in turn had cascading effects on vegetation. We predicted that strong protective effects of pumas on vegetation would be most apparent in habitats where cover and terrain (i.e., physical complexity) facilitated the ambushing strategy of pumas. In 3 different habitats, we evaluated the relationships among predation risk, vicua behavior, and - by deploying vicua exclosures - vegetation structure and productivity. We also examined habitat-specific rates of vegetative regrowth. Risky habitats presented high physical complexity, a disproportionately large number of vicuas killed by pumas, and high relative abundance of pumas. In these habitats, vicuas displayed strong antipredator behaviors and exclosures did not affect vegetation, suggesting that pumas indirectly protected plants. Conversely, a safe habitat presented low structural complexity, a disproportionately low number of vicuas killed by pumas, and low relative abundance of pumas. Here, vicuas relaxed antipredator behaviors and exclosures had strong effects on vegetation. In 1 habitat deemed as risky, however, cascading effects were offset likely because water and nutrients were readily available to plants and regrowth was rapid. Our results show that large ambush carnivores can positively affect vegetation via nonconsumptive effects on their prey, and that these effects are habitat mediated. However, primary productivity modulated the strength of such effects, with high primary productivity dampening the observed cascading effects.  2016 American Society of Mammalogists.",67,2

This leads to a trade-off in investment between defense and growth, and it is likely that tree species specialized to particular habitats tailor this balance to correspond with local resource availability. It has also been suggested that differential herbivore impacts among tree species may drive habitat segregation, favoring species adapted to particular resource conditions. In order to test these predictions, a reciprocal transplant experiment in Sabah, Malaysia, was established with seedlings of five species of Dipterocarpaceae. These were specialized to either alluvial (Hopea nervosa, Parashorea tomentella) or sandstone soils (Shorea multiflora, H. beccariana), or were locally absent (S.fallax). A total of 3000 seedlings were planted in paired gap and understory plots in five sites on alluvial and sandstone soils. Half of all seedlings were fertilized. Seedling growth and mortality were recorded in regular samples over 3.5 years, and rates of insect herbivore damage were estimated from censuses of foliar tissue loss on marked mature leaves and available young leaves. Greater herbivory rates on mature leaves had no measurable effects on seedling growth but were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of mortality during the following year. In contrast, new-leaf herbivory rates correlated with neither growth nor mortality. There were no indications of differential impacts of herbivory among the five species, nor between experimental treatments. Herbivory was not shown to influence segregation of species between soil types, although it may contribute toward differential survival among light habitats. Natural rates of damage were substantially lower than have been shown to influence tree seedling growth and mortality in previous manipulative studies.  2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",70,2

We investigate between-range differences in performance for Verbascum thapsus, a weedy invader known to grow larger in its introduced than native range. Specifically, we question whether adaptation to herbivory or climate best explains increased performance of introduced populations. We grew 14 native and 22 introduced populations of V.thapsus in two common garden locations: near Prague, Czech Republic (native range) and in Colorado, USA (introduced range). By removing herbivores from half of the plants within each garden we tested the prediction of the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis: increased performance is driven by an evolutionary shift of resources away from defence against herbivory towards growth and reproduction. We then investigated whether genetically based clines in performance are expressed along climate gradients within both the native and introduced ranges. On average, seeds produce larger rosettes when collected from the introduced vs. native range. While this evolution of increased growth in introduced populations in part matches the prediction of EICA, climate, not herbivory, best explains this between-range difference. Specifically, seeds collected from the native range produce smaller rosettes as the climate of origin becomes cooler and drier, while there is no cline in performance in rosettes grown from seed collected from the introduced range, which are large regardless of climate of origin. Thus, a climate-based cline within the native range best explains lower average performance of native compared to introduced populations. Synthesis. The breakdown in a potentially adaptive cline emphasizes the need to more closely investigate the evolutionary processes that shape geographic structuring (or its absence) within the introduced range. In addition, EICA is not universally applicable to all invasion scenarios, and our findings underscore the importance of testing the underlying assumptions alongside the predictions of this hypothesis.  2017 The Authors.

For example, corridors may increase the abundance of consumers in a habitat to the detriment of the species they consume. In this study we assessed the impact of corridors on insect herbivory of a native plant, Solanum americanum, in large-scale, experimentally fragmented landscapes. We quantified leaf herbivory and assessed fruit production as a proxy for plant fitness. We also conducted field surveys of grasshoppers (Orthoptera), a group of abundant, generalist herbivores that feed on S. americanum, and we used exclosure cages to explicitly link grasshopper herbivory to fruit production of individual S. americanum. The presence of corridors did not increase herbivory or decrease plant fruit production. Likewise, corridors did not increase grasshopper abundance. Instead, patches in our landscapes with the least amount of edge habitat and the greatest amount of warmer ""core"" area had the highest levels of herbivory, the largest cost to plant fruit production as a result of herbivory, and the most grasshoppers. Thus habitat quality, governed by patch shape, can be more important than connectivity for determining levels of herbivory and the impact of herbivory on plant fitness in fragmented landscapes.  2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",72,2

The holoparasite Cuscuta gronovii is native to much of the US with a broad host range including Verbesina alternifolia, an understory perennial. Both species grow in moderate to moist soils and occur in habitats that may experience prolonged or episodic drought. We applied the Wise-Abrahamson Limiting Resource Model (LRM) developed for plant-herbivore relations to examine the effects of pattern of drought stress on tolerance of V. alternifolia to parasitism by C. gronovii. Individual plants were assigned one of six treatments that were combinations of parasite (none or addition of parasite) and drought stress (well-watered, continuously-stressed, or pulse-stressed). After pulse-stressed plants had experienced two wet-dry cycles all plants were harvested. Parasitism strongly reduced both shoot and root mass and well-watered hosts exhibited the greatest decline, indicating reduced tolerance to parasitism when water was readily available. This is consistent with the LRM if parasitism limits photosynthates available to the host. However, parasitism increased allocation to shoot and this effect did not differ between well-watered and drought-stressed plants, indicating equal tolerance. This outcome is in accord with an alternative prediction of the LRM if hosts are not carbon limited. Total pot productivity was reduced by parasitism and drought stress, and this effect was greater for pulse-stressed than for continuously-stressed hosts. We discuss the applicability of the LRM for understanding the effects of drought on tolerance to parasitism.  2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",73,1

We examined the interactive effects of belowground resource limitations by varying nutrient and water availability, and aboveground carbon limitation imposed by a single defoliation event (40% leaf removal) on stem growth, whole-tree and within-tree resource allocation patterns (total non-structural carbohydrate and nitrogen) and below- and aboveground biomass allocation patterns in 8-month-old, field-grown Eucalyptus globulus Labill. saplings. Two months after treatments were imposed, the direction of the stem growth response to defoliation depended on the abiotic treatment. Five months after defoliation, however, we found little evidence that resource availability constrained the expression of tolerance to defoliation. With the exception of the combined low-nutrient and low-water supply treatment, saplings grown with (1) adequate water and nutrient supplies and even with (2) low-water supply or (3) low-nutrient supply were able to compensate for the 40% foliage loss. The observed compensatory responses were attributed to the activation of several short- and longer-term physiological mechanisms including reduced biomass allocation to coarse roots, mobilization of carbohydrate reserves, robust internal N dynamics and increased ratio of foliage to wood dry mass.",74,2

Most of the evidence for the defensive mutualism concept is derived from studies of agronomic grass cultivars, which may be atypical of many endophyte-host interactions. I argue that endophytes in native plants, even asexual, seed-borne ones, rarely act as defensive mutualists. In contrast to domesticated grasses where infection frequencies of highly toxic plants often approach 100%, natural grass populations are usually mosaics of uninfected and infected plants. The latter, however, usually vary enormously in alkaloid levels, from none to levels that may affect herbivores. This variation may result from diverse endophyte and host genotypic combinations that are maintained by changing selective pressures, such as competition, herbivory and abiotic factors. Other processes, such as spatial structuring of host populations and endophytes that act as reproductive parasites of their hosts, may maintain infection levels of seed-borne endophytes in natural populations, without the endophyte acting as a mutualist.",75,2

We studied the effect of a major insect herbivore (leaf-cutting ants, LCA) on plant fitness in several species of Monte Desert, assessing both the direct negative effect of ant defoliation and the indirect positive role of ants as soil improvers. To estimate the negative and positive effects on plants, we sampled 7000 plant fragments carried by the ants and analyzed the nutrient contents of refuse dumps in 15 ant nests. We estimated plant fitness measuring ~10,000 flowers and ~3600 fruits of 122 individuals from 7 of the most common plant species within the ant foraging area. First, we compared the fitness between plants growing on the nutrient-rich refuse dumps and co-specifics on adjacent non-nest soils. Second, using hierarchical confirmatory path analysis model, we analyzed how herbivory and nutrient content of refuse dumps affected plant fitness. We found that the fitness of plants growing on refuse dumps (a) was similar than those growing on adjacent non-nest soils, and (b) was unaffected by ant harvesting or by increments in nutrient content in a consistent way. In this dry habitat, the effect of LCA on plant fitness was complex and species-dependent. To explain this pattern, we discuss the role of plant compensation to foliar damage, the limited plant response to soil nutrients due to water stress and the potential high abundance plant consumers on ant refuse dumps. Our results illustrate the complexity of herbivore-plant interactions emphasizing the need of measuring direct and indirect effects of herbivory in field conditions to validate greenhouse experiments.  2016, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",76,2

Such lack of coevolutionary evidence could be related to frugivores selecting plants based on environmental cues, rather than on plant phenotypic traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, I examined whether the pattern and extent of fruit predation by long-tailed field mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) on the perennial herb Helleborus foetidus was directly related to mouse abundance, to environmental cues, to plant phenotypic traits, or to a combination of these. Thus, I estimated mouse relative abundance (through livetrapping) and percentages of fruit predation by mice, and quantified plant environmental and phenotypic traits in 9 populations of H. foetidus in southeastern Spain during 2 years (overall, 254 plants). I found substantial variation among populations in mouse trapping success (ranging from 0.0 to 21.8 individuals/100 trap nights), size of fruit crops (8.6-28.9 fruits per plant), and percentages of fruit predation by mice (0.0-93.3%). However, no simple relationship was found between mouse abundance (as estimated by trapping success) and strength of fruit predation. None of the 4 measured plant phenotypic traits (e.g., number of fruits or plant size) had a significant effect on mouse foraging. Conversely, 2 of the 6 environmental traits considered (substrate and distance to nearest tree) influenced fruit predation by mice. Plants located on rocky substrates and nearby trees experienced higher percentages of predation and this result was rather consistent across the 2 years and the 2 levels considered (inter- and intrapopulation). Even though mice could have selected other plant phenotypic traits not accounted for (e.g., chemical traits), such hypothetical phenotypic selection appears to be inconsequential as a source of individual variation in H. foetidus maternal fitness because its effects could have been ""diluted"" by the overwhelming influence of environmental factors. Thus, the results support the initial hypothesis that the net outcomes of the interaction between H. foetidus and mice in southeastern Spain may not have strong coevolutionary consequences.  2005 American Society of Mammalogists.",77,2

Furthermore, whether consumer-facilitated fungal infection differentially affects newly establishing plants in mudflats compared to mature stands remains poorly understood. In a salt marsh in southern Brazil, we examined the effects of herbivory by the crab Neohelice granulata and fungal infection on the survival and growth of Spartina alterniflora transplanted into mudflats. We additionally tested the effects of herbivory and fungi on newly established versus well-established stands of S. alterniflora. Highly intensive natural crab herbivory significantly reduced the development of S. alterniflora and increased its fungal infection by 50%. Light herbivory, removing only small areas of plant leaves, reduced the height growth and leaf production of directly affected tillers by about 14 to 18%, and both newly and well-established, clonally integrated stands of S. alterniflora allocated energy towards the formation of new tillers. While herbivory facilitated fungal infection and subsequent fungal damage in leaves, no significant effects of fungicide treatment or its interactions with crab grazing on S. alterniflora growth were detected, suggesting a saprophytic rather than a pathogenic role of fungi in this 3-species interaction.

One possible strategy is the induced production of metabolites following herbivore attack. Plant-associated micro-organisms can be the source of such defensive compounds. For example, cool-season grasses can be associated with systemic endophytic fungi of the genus Epichlo, which produce herbivore-toxic alkaloids. In a controlled common garden approach, we tested the hypothesis that different types of herbivory induce endophyte growth and increase the endophyte-mediated production of three bioactive alkaloids which can deter or toxify herbivores. During 18weeks, we analysed biweekly endophyte and alkaloid concentrations in the grass Lolium perenne infected with the endophytic fungus Epichlo festucae var. lolii. The experiment was conducted throughout the field season and compared three different herbivore treatments to the control treatment (herbivory exclosure). We showed that the concentration of the vertebrate toxic alkaloid lolitrem B increased following clipping (a simulation of grazing herbivores), while the insect deterring alkaloid peramine increased following locust herbivory (bitingchewing herbivores). The endophyte concentration increased slightly following clipping (P=009). Sap sucking aphids altered neither endophyte nor alkaloid concentrations.

Significant interactions between nutrient and clipping on RHGR, total biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) were also found.

Specifically, we determined (1) the costs in terms of yield of all three defences, (2) the possible tradeoffs among them, and (3) if oviposition preference was related to the expression of these defences. We detected no costs in terms of yield of constitutive and induced resistance to tuber damage. We did, however, find evidence of costs of being able to tolerate tuber herbivory. While we found no tradeoffs among any of the estimated defences, there was a positive correlation between aboveground compensatory growth and tolerance in terms of tuber production, suggesting that after damage there are no shifts in the allocation of resources from aboveground to belowground biomass. Finally, we found that females laid more eggs on those varieties with the lowest level of constitutive resistance. In conclusion our findings suggest that in potatoes, breeding for higher yields has not caused any reduction in constitutive or induced resistance to tuber damage. This is not the case for tolerance where those varieties with higher yields are also less likely to tolerate tuber damage. Given the high incidence of tuber pests in Colombia, selecting for higher tolerance could allow for high productivity in the presence of herbivores. Finding mechanisms to decouple the tolerance response from yield should be a new priority in potato breeding in Colombia to guarantee a higher yield in both the presence and absence of herbivores.  2017 Garrido et al.

Its population increased dramatically over the last decades in Western Europe, leading to concerns about its potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, swan consequences on fishponds remain poorly investigated, although fishpond animal communities and economic value both largely depend on aquatic macrophytes. We carried out an experiment in the Dombes region (Eastern France) with 96 exclosures on 24 fishponds. Our aim was to assess the impact of swan grazing on aquatic macrophyte presence, abundance and community structure (diversity and evenness) during the growing season (April to July). We also considered the potential effect of swan stay (i.e. number of swan days ha-1) and nutrient availability on macrophyte depletion. Swan grazing negatively affected the presence and abundance (% cover) of macrophyte beds, particularly at high swan density. No significant effect on dry biomass was found. Furthermore, swan grazing negatively affected community structure, suggesting that mute swan promoted the dominance of a few species in macrophyte communities. Whatever the macrophyte variable considered, nutrient availability in fishponds did not affect macrophyte depletion rate. It is speculated that both the repeated use of the same fishponds by birds and their expansion within the landscape may lead to more acute and broader consequences for macrophyte beds over the longer term.  2011 Elsevier B.V.",87,2

However, little is known about the role of various external factors that may determine the nature of inducible defenses. Here we tested whether light level under which plants grow could affect the natural invasion of two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) with a broad range of host plants. For this study we used two host species that differ widely in shade tolerance: shade-adapted Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and sun-adapted European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.). The purpose of this study was to explore mite invasion and to test whether prior simulated defoliation, light conditions and host species differences in secondary defense metabolites (soluble phenolics) play a role in the pattern of invasion. One-year-old maple and ash seedlings growing in pots were placed into two shade houses that produced a treatment with 5% light transmittance, and the second group of seedlings was placed in full sunlight. The experiment was carried out in a location chronically affected by spider mite presence. The defoliation was performed in mid-May by manual removal of 0 (control), 25, 50, 75 and 100% of leaves. Natural two-spotted spider mite invasion took place in mid-July and was observed only on seedlings growing in the shade. Mites were found on leaves of almost all seedlings. However, the intensity of feeding damage to leaves was related to the level of earlier defoliation. Control and slightly to moderately (25-50%) defoliated seedlings of both species were most affected by spider mites. Mite feeding behavior was directly linked to changes in concentration of leaf carbon and phenolic compounds. Carbon content was positively correlated with the percent of seedlings damaged by spider mites in both tree species (R2&gt; 0.80; P &lt;0.05). The highest concentration of phenolic compounds was observed in leaves of seedlings subjected to 50 and 75% defoliation. Our results indicated that two-spotted spider mites preferred plants grown in a shade environment and within these plants favored leaves which are high in carbon and low in phenolic compounds. Both plant species were able to survive early season leaf damage inflicted by spider mites. Inducible phenolic compounds were among defensive secondary metabolites contributing to low spider mite success in plants recovering from artificial spring defoliation.",90,2

Response of the invasive alga starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) to control efforts in a Minnesota lake. Lake Reserv Manage. 00:0000. Starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa), an invasive green macroalga in the family Characeae, has recently been found for the first time in several Midwestern states. This aquatic invasive species is of increasing concern to management agencies, lakeshore property owners, and other stakeholders. Starry stonewort has proven difficult to control, partly due to its ability to reproduce via bulbils (asexual reproductive structures). There has also been a lack of applied research addressing the efficacy of current management practices for controlling starry stonewort. We examined the effects of mechanical and algaecide treatments on starry stonewort biomass, bulbil density, and bulbil viability by monitoring treated areas and untreated reference locations concurrent with management implemented on Lake Koronis in Minnesota. Chelated copper algaecide applications alone and in combination with mechanical harvesting significantly reduced starry stonewort biomass, but algaecide treatment alone failed to reduce the capacity of starry stonewort to regenerate via bulbils. A second, granular algaecide application following an initial treatment with liquid algaecide did not further reduce biomass in any treated area and was associated with a substantial increase in bulbil density in an area treated with algaecide alone. Bulbil viability was greatest in the area treated only with algaecide (86%) and an untreated reference area (84%) and was lowest in an area treated with both mechanical harvest and algaecide (70%). The ability of starry stonewort to regenerate and persist following algaecide treatment is concerning. Multi-pronged management incorporating both chemical and mechanical approaches may improve outcomes of starry stonewort control efforts.  2018,  Copyright by the North American Lake Management Society 2018.",91,2

However, the advance of ecology requires making generalizations that synthesize current knowledge and guide new basic research and practical applications. Among the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis is one of the most accurate and powerful methods. This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant ecology from populations to ecosystems. The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of meta-analyses. The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g. landscape fragmentation). Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and informing the scope of generalizations. However, plant ecologists can only take full advantage of this capacity if we improve our knowledge on how and when to conduct a proper meta-analysis, and by avoiding the frequent misuses that have characterized the use of this statistical tool in the ecological literature thus far.  2014 British Ecological Society.",92,2

However, little empirical information exists on the real effect that these organisms have on plant populations. With a long-term (seven-year) ungulate exclusion experiment in two areas of southeastern Spain, I demonstrated that these organisms can affect not only individual performance, but also the population dynamics and spatial structure of two short-lived monocarpic herbs, Erysimum mediohispanicum and E. baeticum. There was between-year and among-microhabitat variability in damage, with plants growing under shrubs being less damaged than those growing in open sites. Ungulates consumed flowers and fruits, severely decreasing plant reproductive output. The postdispersal seed predation rate increased after ungulates were excluded, presumably as a consequence of the relaxation of competition between seed predators and ungulates. The effect of ungulates on Erysimum early establishment was nonsignificant, although >50% of Erysimum seedlings died due to ungulate trampling. The exclusion experiment also revealed that, as a consequence of their impact on seed production, ungulates affected the population dynamics of their host plants; their removal produced a significant increase in the abundance of the two studied plant species. Furthermore, habitat distribution of plants was also influenced by the activity of ungulates. In control plots, most Erysimum individuals grew under the canopy of co-occurring shrubs. In contrast, a dramatic spatial redistribution of plants occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, where they started to colonize open sites. Consequently, the spatial structure of the plants excluded from ungulates significantly differed from that in control plots and became statistically similar to the structure expected according to the cover of every microhabitat. Finally, this experiment revealed that, for plants inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, abundance and spatial structure are tightly related. Thus, I found that abundance increased in ungulate-excluded plots due not to a general and homogeneous increase, but to a significant increase in those microhabitats inaccessible to ungulates in control plots. These findings suggest that herbivory effects on plants are intricate, affecting not only their performance or population dynamics, but also their habitat distribution and niche structure.  2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",93,2

However, ecological communities are among the most complex natural systems, and thus the interactions between species are far from simple. In this respect, the importance of indirect effects (those effects transmitted from one species to another through one or more intermediate species) as a determinant of the structure and dynamics of ecological communities has been clearly acknowledged only in recent years (Wootton 1994, Abrams 1995, Abrams et al. 1996). Indirect effects are those transmitted from one species to another through one or more intermediate species. These indirect effects can be propagated through food webs as a consequence of changes in the density of the intervening species, a mechanism known as density-mediated indirect interaction (DMII) (Abrams 1995, Werner and Peacor 2003). Nevertheless, indirect effects can also occur through changes in the phenotypes of the interacting organisms, a mechanism known as trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII) (Werner and Peacor 2003, Schmitz et al. 2004). Although DMIIs have been traditionally considered to be the main source of any variation in ecological communities, ecologists are progressively more conscious of the essential role played by TMIIs (Bolker et al. 2003, Dill et al. 2003, Luttbeg et al. 2003, Trussell et al. 2003, Werner and Peacor 2003; and chapters throughout this volume).

Mutualistic and antagonistic above-ground and below-ground species have the potential to be involved in strong interactions that can either weaken or strengthen their individual impacts on plants. Their impacts can also have delayed effects on a plant's progeny by altering offspring traits and survival. Few studies have explored the effect of herbivore and detritivore interactions with parent plants on offspring vital life-cycle processes, such as seedling emergence rate, seedling establishment and offspring survival. 2. In the field, I experimentally studied the combined effects of floral herbivores (FH), root herbivores (RH) and detritivores on plant growth and reproduction of Moricandia moricandioides (Brassicaceae). In particular, I analysed the trans-generational effects of herbivores and detritivores on seed and juvenile production as well as on vital life-cycle processes (i.e. seedling emergence rates, survival). 3. Floral herbivores strongly reduced the number of flowers, fruits, seeds and juveniles. Detritivores had an impact on plant success by increasing seed quality (\% N and N : C ratio), although the effect was altered by the presence of floral and RH. 4. I found maternal effects (trans-generational effects) of FH, RH and detritivores. Floral herbivores reduced seedling emergence and establishment. Floral and RH in combination reduced seedling emergence timing, but the effect was counteracted by detritivores. Detritivores also reduced the negative effect of FH on offspring mortality rate. 5.

Many studies have attempted to document plant response to warming by grouping species into functional groups. Within functional groups, however, species often display divergent responses. Determining how foliar functional traits might be used to predict plant responses to warming could reduce analytical complexity while maintaining generalizations across systems. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis on 18 studies (consisting of 38 species) of plant biomass response to experimental or natural warming. We determined whether plant trait estimates associated with the leaf economics spectrum [leaf life span (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (Nmass), leaf phosphorus (Pmass), photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and stomatal conductance (Gs)] from a global plant database of experimentally unmanipulated plants, GloPNet, could be used to predict biomass response to experimental warming. Results: We found that three single leaf traits (LL, Nmass and Amax) were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming treatments, perhaps due to their association with plant growth rates, adaptation rate and ability, each explaining between 21-46% of the variation in plant biomass responses. The magnitude of response to warming decreased with increasing LL, but increased with increasing Nmass and Amax. We found no linear combination of any of these traits that predicted warming response. Conclusions: These results show that foliar traits can aid in understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to temperature across species. Because each trait only explained a portion of variation in how plant growth responded to warming, however, future studies that examine how plant communities respond to warming should simultaneously measure multiple leaf traits, especially those most sensitive to warming, across plant species, to determine whether the predictive ability of functional traits changes between different ecosystems or plant taxonomic groups. Using a meta-analysis of plant biomass response to warming, and a global plant database, we found that leaf traits LL, Nmass, and Amax were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming treatments, each explaining between 21-46% of the variation in plant biomass responses.

Although ecologists are now using a variety of approaches to study how much and through what mechanisms increasing temperature and nutrient pollution may influence the invasions inherent in range shifts, accurate predictions are still lacking. Methods and Results: In this study, we conducted a factorial experiment, simultaneously manipulating warming, nitrogen addition and introduction of Pityopsis aspera, to determine how range-shifting species affect a plant community. We quantified the resident community using ordination scores, then used structural equation modeling to examine hypotheses related to how plants respond to a network of experimental treatments and environmental variables. Variation in soil pH explained plant community response to nitrogen addition in the absence of invasion. However, in the presence of invasion, the direct effect of nitrogen on the community was negligible and soil moisture was important for explaining nitrogen effects. We did not find effects of warming on the native plant community in the absence of invasion. In the presence of invasion, however, warming had negative effects on functional richness directly and invasion and herbivory explained the overall positive effect of warming on the plant community. Conclusions and Significance: This work highlights the variation in the biotic and abiotic factors responsible for explaining independent and collective climate change effects over a short time scale. Future work should consider the complex and non-additive relationships among factors of climate change and invasion in order to capture more ecologically relevant features of our changing environment.  2015 Gornish, Miller.",99,2

Most studies have focused on negative component interactions (e.g. predation, herbivory) without considering the relative importance of positive interactions (e.g. mutualism, facilitation) for determining net indirect effects. In plant/arthropod communities, ants have multiple top-down effects via mutualisms with honeydew-producing herbivores and harassment of and predation on other herbivores; these ant effects provide opportunities for testing the relative importance of positive and negative interspecific interactions. We manipulated the presence of ants, honeydew-producing membracids and leaf-chewing beetles on perennial host plants in field experiments in Colorado to quantify the relative strength of these different types of interactions and their impact on the ant's net indirect effect on plants. In 2007, we demonstrated that ants simultaneously had a positive effect on membracids and a negative effect on beetles, resulting in less beetle damage on plants hosting the mutualism. In 2008, we used structural equation modelling to describe interaction strengths through the entire insect herbivore community on plants with and without ants. The ant's mutualism with membracids was the sole strong interaction contributing to the net indirect effect of ants on plants. Predation, herbivory and facilitation were weak, and the net effect of ants reduced plant reproduction. This net indirect effect was also partially because of behavioural changes of herbivores in the presence of ants. An additional membracid manipulation showed that the membracid's effect on ant activity was largely responsible for the ant's net effect on plants; ant workers were nearly ten times as abundant on plants with mutualists, and effects on other herbivores were similar to those in the ant manipulation experiment. These results demonstrate that mutualisms can be strong relative to negative direct interspecific interactions and that positive interactions deserve attention as important components of ecological webs.  2011 The Authors.

Here we seek to understand how abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change can affect plant-herbivore interactions in a model crop species (soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.) by answering three questions: (1) Do the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change cause synergistic negative effects on plant biomass? (2) Can abiotic stress affect resistance of plants to insect herbivores? (3) Does genetic variation in plant traits modify a plant's response to stress? We performed three experiments in controlled growth environments using up to 51 soybean genotypes selected to vary in numerous traits associated with drought and resistance against pests (e. g., insect herbivores, nematodes, and pathogenic fungi), and up to 3 generalist-feeding herbivorous noctuid moth species (Helicoverpa zea, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua) that commonly feed on soybean in North America. Drought and herbivory had the largest and the most consistent negative effects on plant performance, reducing the above- and below-ground biomass by 10-45 %, whereas increased temperature had little to no effect on plants. Drought also increased susceptibility to generalist noctuid herbivores, but these results varied dramatically in magnitude and direction among plant genotypes. Our experiments show that the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on soybean biomass were largely due to the additive effects of these stresses, and there exists substantial genetic variation in the soybean germplasm pool we studied that could be used as a source of parental stock in breeding new crops that can more effectively tolerate and resist the combined negative effects of insect herbivory and drought.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",101,2

It is therefore important to understand how changes in such abiotic and biotic stressors might impact agroecosystems. The plant stress hypothesis predicts that, owing to physiological and biochemical changes, plants experiencing drought will be more susceptible to insect herbivory, which could have synergistic negative effects on plant performance. By contrast, the plant vigor hypothesis predicts that insects will preferentially feed on fast-growing vigorous plants. These hypotheses were tested in a field experiment using 16 soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) genotypes to determine: (i) the combined effects of drought and herbivory on plant performance; (ii) the impact of drought on soybean resistance to herbivores; and (iii) how genetically variable phenotypic traits in soybean correlate with these responses. It was found that drought had a greater effect on soybean performance than herbivory, and drought and herbivory did not interact to impact on any measure of plant performance. Drought caused decreased insect herbivory on average, suggesting that the plant vigor hypothesis is consistent with the effects of drought stress on soybean resistance to leaf-chewing insect herbivores. This conclusion is further supported by genotypic correlations which show that plant growth rate is positively correlated with the amount of herbivory plants received. These results suggest that, although the effects of climate-associated changes in drought and herbivory will have negative effects on soybean, these potential effects are quantifiable with simple experiments and can be mitigated through continued breeding of varieties that are tolerant and resistant to these abiotic and biotic stressors.  2013.",102,2

The sedge Eriophorum vaginatum is the dominant graminoid in arctic mesic tundra, and is heavily consumed by caribou. Here, we compare the principal compensatory growth models in explaining the impact of a single episode of simulated caribou grazing at two clipping intensities on E. vaginatum total growing season shoot production, nitrogen concentrations, and nitrogen pools, over two successive years across a soil nitrogen fertilisation gradient. The clipping treatments had no effect on shoot production in the growing season when they were applied, but substantially reduced growth in the following year. Surprisingly, these reductions were consistent across all levels of soil nitrogen availability. The Limiting Resource Model can best explain this legacy effect on production because it predicts alternate compensatory growth responses depending on whether or not the herbivory affects availability of the resource that most limits plant growth. Accordingly, our results suggest that shoot compensatory growth in the year after the clipping was limited by some resource other than nitrogenprobably internal carbohydrate reserves or soil phosphorus. The clipping treatments initially enhanced shoot nitrogen concentrations and pools, but shoot nitrogen pools had decreased by the end of the second year due to the legacy effect of reduced shoot production. Finally, inflorescence removal substantially stimulated new shoot production in both years. Together, our results suggest that herbivory can significantly enhance temporal and local spatial heterogeneity in graminoid growth and nitrogen cycling.  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",103,2

Ecological theory, individual experiments in many different systems, and system-specific quantitative reviews have suggested that (i) bottom-up control is pervasive but top-down control is more influential in aquatic habitats relative to terrestrial systems and (ii) bottom-up and top-down forces are interdependent, with statistical interactions that synergize or dampen relative influences on producer biomass. We used simple dynamic models to review ecological mechanisms that generate independent vs. interactive responses of community-level biomass. We calibrated these mechanistic predictions with the metrics of factorial meta-analysis and tested their prevalence across freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 191 factorial manipulations of herbivores and nutrients. Our analysis showed that producer community biomass increased with fertilization across all systems, although increases were greatest in freshwater habitats. Herbivore removal generally increased producer biomass in both freshwater and marine systems, but effects were inconsistent on land. With the exception of marine temperate rocky reef systems that showed positive synergism of nutrient enrichment and herbivore removal, experimental studies showed limited support for statistical interactions between nutrient and herbivory treatments on producer biomass. Top-down control of herbivores, compensatory behaviour of multiple herbivore guilds, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of interactions, and herbivore-mediated nutrient recycling may lower the probability of consistent interactive effects on producer biomass. Continuing studies should expand the temporal and spatial scales of experiments, particularly in understudied terrestrial systems; broaden factorial designs to manipulate independently multiple producer resources (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, light), multiple herbivore taxa or guilds (e.g. vertebrates and invertebrates) and multiple trophic levels; and - in addition to measuring producer biomass - assess the responses of species diversity, community composition and nutrient status.  2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",104,2

Here, we examined central predictions of the limiting resource model (LRM), according to which high resource availability can support damage tolerance in plants with deterministic apical dominance, but will have limited or no effect in plants that are induced to increase branching by increased resource availability regardless of damage. We examined these predictions by studying the branching patterns of Medicago truncatula plants in response to both light and water availabilities and their effects on tolerance of apical damage. We used plants from environments that were predicted to select for different levels of apical dominance. Intact plants from the more productive and competitive population exhibited strong apical dominance and refrained from branching even under full light, whereas plants from the less productive and sparser population exhibited greater plasticity in apical dominance and readily branched under high water and light. In accordance with the LRM, these differences translated into differential responsiveness to apical damage: given abundant water, apical damage induced the activation of lateral meristems and increased pod and seed production in plants from the more productive environment, but not in plants from the less productive environment. These results suggest an adaptive association between deterministic inhibition of lateral meristems and compensatory ability, which supports the hypothesis that greater compensatory responsiveness to apical damage could be a derivative of adaptation to other environmental stresses, such as light competition.  2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",105,2

We tested the hypothesis that elevated CO2 would reduce resistance (i.e., the ability to prevent damage) but enhance tolerance (i.e., the ability to regrow and compensate for damage after the damage has occurred) of tomato plants to the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that elevated CO2 reduced resistance by decreasing the jasmonic acid (JA) level and activities of lipoxygenase, proteinase inhibitors, and polyphenol oxidase in wild-type (WT) plants infested with H. armigera. Consequently, the activities of total protease, trypsin-like enzymes, and weak and active alkaline trypsin-like enzymes increased in the midgut of H. armigera when fed on WT plants grown under elevated CO2. Unexpectedly, the tolerance of the WT to H. armigera (in terms of photosynthetic rate, activity of sucrose phosphate synthases, flower number, and plant biomass and height) was also reduced by elevated CO2. Under ambient CO2, the expression of resistance and tolerance to H. armigera was much greater in wild type than in spr2 (a JA-deficient genotype) plants, but elevated CO2 reduced these differences of the resistance and tolerance between WT and spr2 plants. The results suggest that the JA signaling pathway contributes to both plant resistance and tolerance to herbivorous insects and that by suppressing the JA signaling pathway, elevated CO2 will simultaneously reduce the resistance and tolerance of tomato plants.  2012 Guo et al.",106,2

When effects were present, neighbouring vegetation reduced plant growth and survival, and insect herbivores decreased relative biomass allocation to roots and increased plant mortality. 4 Although reduced herbivory caused by insecticide application had little direct effects on plant biomass, it did interact with competition to affect growth for three of the four species. Herbivory reduced the strength of competition experienced by Coreopsis, but increased it in Linum. For both Coreopsis and Helianthus, the combined effects of herbivory and competition on plant growth were less than expected from a simple multiplicative response. 5 We suggest that interactions were found because we used an experimental design that modified insect densities on both neighbours and the focal plant, allowing for determination of both direct and indirect effects. 6 We suggest that the antagonistic interactions between competition and herbivory may have occurred because herbivores altered the competitive environment by harming the neighbouring plants, or because the presence of neighbours facilitated focal plant growth by distributing herbivore loads over the greater amount of plant biomass available. 7 Although as an isolated factor competition is more intense in this system than insect herbivory, herbivory can alter the strength of competitive interactions and thus its importance cannot be determined by measuring intensity alone. This result emphasizes that these two ecological processes are not truly discrete, and further suggests that studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple ecological processes are needed.",107,2

To better understand how land-use history might mediate the effect of insect herbivory on the growth of four herbaceous plant species at the edges between woodlands and open savannas, we coupled large-scale manipulations of canopy structure by thinning overstory trees to create savanna habitat in non-agricultural and post-agricultural longleaf pine woodlands with local-scale herbivore exclosures at two distances from habitat edges. Light availability, grasshopper abundance, and herbaceous plant cover all increased in patches that received overstory tree thinning. Land-use history altered the effect that edges created by the overstory thinning treatments had on grasshopper herbivory for one plant species (Carphephorus bellidifolius). The edge between land-use histories also altered herbivore effects on three plant species in thinned patches. These edge effects were driven in part by changes in availability of alternative resources for grasshoppers, shady edges, or grasshopper abundance. Canopy manipulation also had important effects on herbivory that were independent of the habitat edge: grasshopper herbivory reduced plant growth of the smallest species (C. bellidifolius) regardless of canopy manipulation, whereas herbivory on two larger species (Solidago nemoralis and So. odora) reduced plant growth mainly in patches with an intact overstory canopy. Collectively, this work suggests that the species-specific effects of grasshopper herbivory on plant growth were driven by both plant traits (e.g., size or growth rates) and landscape-mediated changes to grasshopper abundance, light availability, or availability of alternative resources for grasshoppers created by land-use history and canopy structure. Furthermore, because the heterogeneity in herbivory revealed by our large-scale experiment is likely linked to plant traits, our results provide a means for understanding the profound, but often idiosyncratic, effects of land-use legacies and edges on plant populations and communities.  2015 Hahn and Orrock.",110,2

If environmental heterogeneity is an important mechanism influencing plant defense traits, then defense expression should co-vary spatially with environmental conditions and change as succession progresses. In this study, we examined how spatial heterogeneity and succession influence putative resistance and tolerance trait levels in late goldenrod Solidago altissima. We quantified the spatial distributions of herbivore damage and traits associated with resistance (leaf toughness, phenolics), tolerance (specific leaf area, relative growth rate, leaf addition rate and leaf senescence rate), and fitness (height, diameter, inflorescence biomass) of goldenrods within replicate early- and late-successional fields. Also, we characterized the local neighborhood (stem density, canopy cover, ground vegetative cover) and edaphic conditions (soil moisture, pH, N) surrounding each target ramet, and determined relationships between these environmental variables and goldenrod trait levels. The distribution of traits within fields was strongly non-random, and defense-trait levels were more strongly spatially structured (i.e. autocorrelated) in late- than in early-successional fields. Also, defense traits were most strongly correlated with aspects of the local plant neighborhood, and these relationships differed in important ways between successional stages. In late-successional fields, tolerance trait specific leaf area was positively correlated with canopy cover and negatively correlated with stem density. In early-successional fields, the relationship between ground vegetative cover and resistance (i.e. 1 - damage) was significantly stronger than in late-successional fields. A novel insight from this study is the possibility that changes in the biotic environment during succession may shift the expression of defense from a resistance to a tolerance strategy in our system. This study highlights the context dependence of plant defense trait levels, which may promote their spatial and temporal variability in heterogeneous landscapes.  2011 The Authors.

An important complication of modular construction is that individuals can rapidly decrease in size when some modules are removed or die or when an individual fragments. Most attempts to describe life histories and population dynamics of modular organisms classify individuals according to their size. This approach relies on the fundamental assumption that fragmentation and module loss have no consequences for an individual apart from a simple decrease in size. Here we experimentally test this assumption. Using a modular marine invertebrate, the encrusting bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata, as a model species, we manipulated colony size and then assessed performance against three potential explanatory models based on size, age, and damage. In a second experiment we disrupted the internal modular demography of colonies to determine whether the performance of a fragment is influenced by the type of modules that remain. Finally, we investigated how constraints on growth in modular organisms uniquely influence growth after module loss. We found that single-state variables such as size or age do not describe performance in our species. Internal constraints substantially reduce growth after a decrease in size, and the age of modules that remain determines the timing of reproductive onset and fecundity. A knowledge of the size history of individuals, including any decreases in size, is necessary to accurately describe life histories and population dynamics in this modular organism. Our results have major consequences for established methods for modeling the demography of modular organisms.  2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",113,2

Soil moisture and nitrogen (N) are among the major factors limiting grassland productivity. In pastures, N fertilizer returns by grazing animals are spatially and temporally heterogenous, and we therefore hypothesized that responses of plants and soil processes to drought may differ at the patch level. Methods: Using rain-exclusion roofs, we simulated severe summer drought in a three-year field experiment replicated at two grassland sites contrasting in climate and management intensity. The study included a factorial N application treatment encompassing the application of cattle urine and mineral nitrogen. Responses of plants, soil microbes, and soil organic matter were assessed (carbon and nitrogen pools). N2O emissions were measured on 72 dates, and soil N2O concentration profiles on 44 dates. Results: Plant productivity responded negatively to drought and positively to N application. Interestingly, no or only small drought-effect were found on plant productivity when cumulated over the entire experimental duration, despite large effects during and shortly after the period when rain-exclusion roofs were installed. We further did not find evidence for compensatory growth after drought, and drought-effects did not differ between fertilizer hot spots and unaffected areas. In the short-term, soil microbial biomass responded positively to drought, but no long-term effects were detected. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions originated primarily from fertilizer hot spots, and these emissions were massively reduced under drought, with effects lasting throughout most of the growing season. On a growing season basis, N2O emissions were estimated to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower under drought. Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that even severe summer drought may have relatively little effect on plant productivity in the type of grassland and climate investigated, at least when considered on an annual basis. In contrast, drought may result in a large and sustained reduction of N2O emissions.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",114,2

Using a meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation and combination. As expected biological responses varied across taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely to intensify in the future.

In particular, little is known about how previous herbivore damage determines plant growth and biomass in an insect species-specific manner. We explored whether herbivore species-specific food demand influences plant growth and biomass. To do this, we conducted a series of experiments and field survey using two specialist butterflies, Sericinus montela and Atrophaneura alcinous, and their host plant, Aristolochia debilis. It is known that A. alcinous larva requires four times more food resources to fulfill its development than S. montela larva. Despite that A. alcinous larvae imposed greater damage on plants than S. montela larvae, plant growth did not differ due to herbivory by these species both in single and multiple herbivory events. On the other hand, total aboveground biomass of the plants was reduced more by A. alcinous than S. montela feeding regardless of the number of herbivory events. Feeding on plants with a history of previous herbivory neither decreased nor increased larval growth. Our results suggest that food demand of the two butterfly species determined subsequent plant biomass, although the plant response may depend on tolerance of the host plant (i.e., ability to compensate for herbivore damage). Such difference in the effects of different herbivore species on host plant biomass is more likely to occur than previously thought, because food demand differs in most herbivore species sharing a host plant.  2016, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.",116,2

The expression of such traits requires the allocation of plant resources, and consequently, trade-offs between tolerance and resistance can occur in plants. For marine algae, little is currently known about the expression of tolerance, the relationship between tolerance and resistance, and the impact of resource availability on these traits. 2.We manipulated herbivory (simulated or real) and nutrient availability in a series of laboratory and field experiments to test for tolerance to different types of damage under varying resource conditions in the brown alga Sargassum cf. podacanthoides. In addition to growth and photosynthetic responses of the alga, we measured the concentration of phlorotannins (secondary metabolites associated with resistance in many brown algae) to test for possible phenotypic trade-offs between traits of tolerance and resistance. Furthermore, we assessed whether the limiting resource model (LRM) could predict algal tolerance under different resource conditions. 3. Sargassum cf. podacanthoides expressed traits of tolerance (increased growth rates and reallocation of resources) that were specific to both the type and severity of herbivory encountered. Consistent with the predictions of the LRM, nitrogen enrichment did not alter the compensatory growth responses of the alga. Correlations between growth and phlorotannin content were variable, dependent on the measure of growth analysed, and only weakly influenced by nutrient availability. Nutrient enrichment, however, consistently changed within-alga patterns of tissue composition and photosynthetic activity. 4.Synthesis. Herbivory in the marine environment is often severe, and, similar to higher plants, tolerance to herbivory may be an important mechanism that maintains the productivity of marine algae. We demonstrate the potential applicability of the terrestrially derived LRM to predict algal tolerance under eutrophic conditions. Nutrient-induced changes to within-alga patterns of tissue composition should also be considered when evaluating the effects of nutrient enrichment on marine communities.

Compensation against herbivory was investigated by experimentally clipping a set of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L. nevadensis) juveniles, grown under different levels of light and nutrient availability. The responses analysed were survival, trunk-diameter growth, leader-shoot growth, increment in number of meristems, RGR, biomass of needles, shoots, root and whole plant, and root-to-shoot ratio. Clipping consistently resulted in a worse survival and performance of pines with respect to unclipped ones. From the factors analysed, light availability was responsible mainly for the variations in plant performance, while the addition of nutrients was much less important. Age was also important, with older pines showing in general better performance after clipping. Overall, clipping invariably had a negative effect on Scots pine, since none of the combinations of abiotic factors used resulted in overcompensation. However, the intensity on this negative effect proved quite variable, from almost an exact compensation in clipped older pines under full sunlight availability to very poor performance and high death probability in younger pines in shade. Scots pine cannot overcompensate after clipping, but, depending of the environmental conditions, the negative result of clipping varies from severe undercompensation to almost exact compensation. Also, small differences in sapling age can promote significant differences in sapling response to clipping and light environment.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",119,2

We investigated red deer grazing and resource interaction effects on the performance and dynamics of the functionally important boreal shrub Vaccinium myrtillus using integral projection models (IPMs). We sampled data from 900 V. myrtillus ramets in 30 plots in two consecutive years across the boreo-nemoral pine forest on the island Svany, western Norway. The plots spanned two environmental gradients: a red deer grazing intensity gradient (assessed by Cervus elaphus faecal pellets), and a relative resource gradient (DCA-ordination of species composition). The use of IPMs enabled projections of population growth rate () using continuous plant size instead of forcing stage division upon the demographic data. We used the environmental gradients as continuous variables to explain the dynamics of V. myrtillus populations and found that both increasing grazing intensity and resource levels negatively affected  of the V. myrtillus populations. Interestingly, these factors interacted: the negative effects of grazing were strongest in the resource-rich vegetation, and higher resource levels reduced  more strongly than at low resource levels when grazing intensities became higher. Populations with  > 1 were projected if the grazing intensity was less than or equal to the mean grazing intensity on the island, and indicated that V. myrtillus is relatively tolerant of grazing. Variance decomposing showed that the decrease of  along the grazing gradient, both at low and high resource levels, was largely caused by reductions in plant growth. The use of IPMs together with important environmental gradients offered novel possibilities to study the synthesised effect of different factors on plant population dynamics. Here, we show that the population response of an abundant boreal shrub to ungulate grazing depends on resource level.  2010 Springer-Verlag.",120,2

In order to survive in grazed and mown habitats, they should also have evolved tolerance to apical damage. We studied the tolerance of eyebright (Euphrasia stricta agg.), a hemiparasitic annual, to varying intensities of apical damage (0%, 10% and 50% cutting) in a common garden experiment in two consecutive seasons with Trifolium repens and Festuca rubra as available hosts. The host environment was manipulated by mowing or by leaving the surrounding vegetation intact. Because root hemiparasitic plants poach resources from their host plants, while the hosts are simultaneously also potential competitors for light, mowing of the surrounding vegetation may have both negative (less host resources available) and positive (reduced competition) effects on hemiparasites. In the present study, neighbourhood mowing tended to improve the growth and fruit production of apically damaged eyebright plants. In the first study year, apically damaged (10% cut) plants produced more branches, higher shoot biomass and more fruits compared to intact plants when the surrounding vegetation was mown. No such overcompensation was observed either in an unmown neighbourhood or in the second year. The plants tolerated more extensive damage less well, and all of the 50% cut plants died in the second year in the unmown neighbourhood. The poor survival of these plants was likely to be due to the unfavourable combination of heavy damage, summer drought and competition with the surrounding vegetation. The present study suggests that Euphrasia, and possibly also other annual meadow herbs, may tolerate relatively well minor apical damage, while more extensive damage is likely to adversely affect their performance. The results also support a compensatory continuum in which grazing tolerance varies from undercompensation (damage decreases plant performance) in unfavourable conditions to overcompensation (damage increases plant performance) in favourable growing conditions. While tolerance to apical damage may contribute to the success of these species, they are poor competitors, and their long-term persistence may hence notably depend on the fact that grazing and mowing suppress stronger competitors by maintaining low vegetation.",121,2

In dioecious species, tolerance to defoliation may differ between genders (e.g. females may suffer more than males), but this topic has so far received little attention. Here, we quantified gender-dependent effects of increased levels (0100\%) of sustained defoliation (applied bi-annually for 2 years) on vital rates in three economically important dioecious understorey palm species in the genus Chamaedorea (C. elegans, C. ernesti-augustii and C. oblongata). We also quantified gender differences in functional and life-history traits and assessed the direct reproductive costs in terms of biomass allocation to reproduction. In the three species, non-defoliated (control) females were smaller and had three to seven times higher reproductive allocation than males. Defoliation did not affect survivorship in any of the three species, except in the 100\% defoliation treatment. Stem growth (RGR) and especially reproduction (probability of reproduction and reproductive output) were negatively affected by defoliation. Females of C. ernesti-augustii suffered higher mortality than males at 100\% defoliation, but this was not the case for the other two species. Also, only in C. ernesti-augustii females exhibited lower RGR than males. In all species, the probability of reproduction did not differ between genders. The reproductive output (production rate of inflorescences) differed among genders only in C. ernesti-augustii, where males were more productive than females. Interestingly, in most cases, defoliation effects on vital rates did not differ significantly between males and females, indicating that tolerance to defoliation was similar between genders. Such results were independent of plant size (stem length). Synthesis. Our results do not support the prevailing theory that the greater reproductive costs of females will lead to reduced tolerance to stresses such as defoliation. The implications of these results and their importance for designing sustainable leaf harvesting regimes are discussed.",122,2

Most studies on top-down vs. bottom-up control of plant biomass focus on nutrients as basal resources, whereas light has received considerably less attention. 2 Effects of light and nutrients may differ because light represents a vertical resource and plant adaptations to acquire light might counteract or facilitate consumer effects. I tested the interaction between light supply and consumer presence in a meta-analysis of experiments that manipulated both these factors factorially and measured the biomass of benthic algae (periphyton). 3 Both grazer removal and light enhancement had positive effects on algal biomass. These two factors showed strong interactions, which exceeded previously observed interaction terms between nutrient supply and grazer removal. Positive light effects on algal biomass were primarily observed in the absence of grazers. Grazer effects became stronger at high light supply, which indicated that high light favours algal growth types that are easily ingested. 4 Further analyses showed that light effects increased with trophic state of the habitat and with algal biomass, indicating enhanced importance of light limitation and self-shading at high nutrient supply. Grazer effects depended on grazer biomass and varied with type of experimental manipulation. 5 This study implies that light is of similar importance as nutrients in resource control of benthic algal biomass. High light levels simultaneously enhance consumer control of algal biomass, resulting in strong resource vs. consumer interactions. Light competition and consumer presence pose a trade-off on algal growth, where growth form may distinguish between adaptations to acquire light and to avoid consumption.  2005 British Ecological Society.",124,2

Whereas the mean prey biomass is generally reduced by consumer presence, the effect on spatial heterogeneity is less clear-cut. A meta-analysis of almost 600 field experiments manipulating the presence of benthic invertebrate or vertebrate grazers was conducted to analyze the effect of grazers on both the absolute spatial variability of periphyton biomass and the relative variability, which was standardized to the mean. Effects on absolute variability were measured as the log response ratio of the standard deviation of biomass (LR-SD), whereas effects on relative variability were measured as the log response ratio of the coefficient of variation of biomass (LR-CV). The overall magnitude and range of LR-SD and LR-CV indicated that grazers not only reduced periphyton biomass, but also substantially altered their spatial distribution. However, grazer effects differed strongly for absolute and relative variability. On average, grazers reduced the absolute spatial variability in prey biomass by 50% (average LRSD = -0.68) but increased the relative variability by 24% (average LR-CV = 0.22). The magnitude of LR-SD strongly depended on the efficiency of grazing, with strong biomass removal leading to strong homogenization. Moreover, LR-CV and LR-SD were significantly affected by habitat type (freshwater vs. coastal) and substrata. Given the importance of spatial heterogeneity for resource uptake, competition and the maintenance of diversity, grazer presence has potentially strong indirect effects on the interactions within prey assemblages.  2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",125,2

In 2006, 20 weevils introduced into cages with single plants in May (when weevils first emerge from overwintering) suppressed seed production for about 9 weeks, while weevils introduced in June (when the first summer generation of adults emerge) did not affect seed phenology. Plants in all cages produced substantial numbers of seeds late in the year, but the average seed (achene) weight was reduced for plants with 20 weevils per plant introduced in May. In 2007, plants grown with some competition from other plants within field cages showed substantial mortality, with 63% of plants with 10 or 20 weevils and 75% of plants with 40 weevils per plant dead by mid-August, compared with 12.5% of control plants. Reproduction was delayed by more than a month in surviving plants with 10 or 20 weevils, and by more than 2 months in the few survivors with 40 weevils. Surviving plants with 40 weevils per plant showed loss of apical dominance, which can allow plants to compensate for herbivore damage, but in the case of a light-adapted vine like P. perfoliata may prevent the plants from achieving needed sun exposure.

Understanding this variability can help optimize invasive species management while also informing our understanding of trophic linkages. To address these issues, we tested three hypotheses with contrasting predictions regarding the likelihood of biocontrol success. (1) The biocontrol effort hypothesis: invasive populations are regulated primarily by top-down effects, predicting that increased biocontrol efforts alone (e.g., more individuals of a given biocontrol agent or more time since agent release) will enhance biocontrol success. (2) The relative fertility hypothesis: invasive populations are regulated primarily by bottom-up effects, predicting that nutrient enrichment will increase dominance by invasives and thus reduce biocontrol success, regardless of biocontrol efforts. (3) The fertility-dependent biocontrol effort hypothesis: top-down effects will only regulate invasive populations if bottom-up effects are weak. It predicts that greater biocontrol efforts will increase biocontrol success, but only in low-nutrient sites. To test these hypotheses, we surveyed 46 sites across three states with prior releases of Galerucella beetles, the most common biocontrol agents used against invasive purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria). We found strong support for the fertility-dependent biocontrol effort hypothesis, as biocontrol success occurred most often with greater biocontrol efforts, but only in low-fertility sites. This result held for early stage metrics of biocontrol success (higher Galerucella abundance) and ultimate biocontrol outcomes (decreased loosestrife plant size and abundance). Presence of the invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea was also inversely related to loosestrife abundance, suggesting that biocontrol-based reductions in loosestrife made secondary invasion by P. arundinacea more likely. Our data suggest that low-nutrient sites be prioritized for loosestrife biocontrol and that future monitoring account for variation in site fertility or work to mitigate it. We introduce a new framework that integrates our findings with conflicting patterns previously reported from other biocontrol systems, proposing a unimodal relationship whereby nutrient availability enhances biocontrol success in low-nutrient sites but hampers it in high-nutrient sites. Our results represent one of the first examples of biocontrol success depending on site fertility, which has the potential to inform biocontrol-based management decisions across entire regions and among contrasting systems.  2015 by the Ecological Society of America",127,2

This study used experimental manipulations on transplanted and naturally occurring mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) seedlings to show the effects of deer browsing and competition from deer-induced, herbaceous turf communities on mountain beech regeneration in New Zealand. Differences in the species composition of these turfs had little effect on mountain beech seedling establishment, but turf removal increased seedling growth and survivorship, showing that competition with other plants had direct effects on mountain beech regeneration. Deer browsing reduced the establishment and growth of seedlings, but the size of this effect did not vary with light and nutrient availability. There was no immediate compositional response of turf communities following the removal of deer browsing. The addition of nutrients appeared to reduce the intensity of belowground competition (stem growth increased relative to root growth) and increase seedling mortality, but there was no effect of changing levels of light. These results showed simple and direct negative effects of deer browsing on mountain beech regeneration. Indirect negative effects on regeneration were caused by deer-induced turf communities. We found little evidence for interactive effects between herbivory, plant competition and the availability of light or nutrients on seedling regeneration, which suggests that these factors acted independently.

Nutrient-rich patches generated by leaf-cutting ants near their nests could modify plants' responses to damage. We performed a greenhouse and a field experiment to evaluate the effects of refuse dumps (RDs) created by Acromyrmex lobicornis on plant compensation for foliar herbivory in roadside areas of the Patagonian steppe. We expected higher tolerance in plants growing in RDs than in adjacent non-nest soils (NNSs). We also assessed whether compensation differed between native and exotic species common in the area. We expected higher compensation in exotic than native plants since they perform better in RDs. Native and exotic plants fully compensated for simulated herbivory resembling natural levels. In the greenhouse, clipped plants achieved similar biomass as control plants and in the field reproductive output was similar between treatments. However, compensation was not higher in RDs than NNSs or in exotic than native plants as expected. Both native and exotic plants in roadside areas may have traits associated with disturbance which allow them to tolerate natural occurring herbivory without compromising their performance.

There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (10 m high) maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.  2014 The Author.

Monitoring and pest management actions are therefore required on a regular basis, to ensure the detection, evaluation and mitigation of potential risks to forest and public health. However, we still lack some of the basic knowledge required for relevant analyses of the risk posed by the pine processionary moth. Pest risk is defined as a combination of three components: (1) pest occurrence, which depends on the spatiotemporal dynamics of populations; (2) plant vulnerability to the pest, resulting in a certain amount of damage; and (3) the socioeconomic impact of damage, depending on the potential value of the plants damaged (Jactel et al. 2012). The population dynamics of the processionary moth has been extensively studied, in particular within the context of climate change (see Battisti et al. 2014, Chap. 2, this volume). Several studies have recently addressed the question of tree and forest vulnerability to pine processionary attacks but a comprehensive review of evidence was missing. This is the first objective of this chapter. In particular we were interested in a better understanding of the ecological mechanisms responsible for the host tree selection, at both the species and individual tree levels.

To do so typically requires knowledge of which plant species are eaten, in what abundance they are eaten, and what their nutritional quality might be. Acquiring such data, however, may be difficult and time consuming. Here, we are proposing a rapid and cost-effective forage quality monitoring tool that combines near infrared (NIR) spectra of fecal samples and easily obtained data on plant community composition. Our approach rests on the premise that NIR spectra of fecal samples collected within low population density exclosures reflect the optimal forage quality of a given landscape. Forage quality can thus be based on the Mahalanobis distance of fecal spectral scans across the landscape relative to fecal spectral scans inside exclosures (referred to as DISTEX). The Gi spatial autocorrelation statistic can then be applied among neighboring DISTEX values to detect and map ""hot spots"" and ""cold spots"" of nutritional quality over the landscape. We tested our approach in a heterogeneous boreal landscape on Anticosti Island (Qubec, Canada), where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations over the landscape have ranged from 20 to 50 individuals/km2 for at least 80 years, resulting in a loss of most palatable and nutritious plant species. Our results suggest that hot spots of forage quality occur when old-growth balsam fir stands comprise >39.8% of 300 ha neighborhoods, whereas cold spots occur in laggs (i.e., transition zones from forest to peatland). In terms of groundlevel indicator plant species, the presence of Canada bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) was highly correlated with hot spots, whereas tamarack (Larix laricina) was highly correlated with cold spots.

In 2004-2005, we compared responses of grassland plants and birds across a chronosequence of pastures that were winter-grazed from 1 yr to 5 yr. We compared winter-grazed pastures to pastures grazed year-round and to local native prairie remnants as starting and endpoints for restoration, respectively. Abundance of native warm-season grasses increased from 2\% to 3\% mean relative frequency in pastures grazed year-round to 18\% to 30\% in winter-grazed pastures, and increased with duration of winter-grazing. Native warm-season grasses accounted for 1-6\% of total live aboveground biomass in pastures grazed year-round, 1-34\% in winter-grazed pastures, and 31-34\% in native prairie remnants. Tall fescue abundance and biomass were similar among grazing treatments, with a trend for tall fescue to be less dominant in winter-grazed pastures. Tall fescue made up 9-40\% of total aboveground biomass in year-round grazed pastures and 10-25\% in winter-grazed pastures. Grassland birds showed variable responses to winter-grazing. Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henslow's sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii) were more abundant in winter-grazed pastures, whereas eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) and grasshopper sparrows (A. sauannarum) had similar abundance in pastures grazed year-round and during winter. Winter-grazing of pastures dominated by tall fescue combined with suspension of nitrogen fertilization could be an effective restoration technique that allows use of prairie rangeland while improving habitat for sensitive grassland birds.",136,2

Protective environments (i.e. plastic tunnels) are now frequently used for soft fruit production, which may affect the localized climate and alter such interactions. This two year study on red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) addressed how protected environments affected two aphid species; the large raspberry aphid Amphorophora idaei (LRA) and the small raspberry aphid Aphis idaei (SRA). Temperatures were higher (up to 7-10 C) in tunnels compared with the field. Plants in tunnels grew approximately 1.4 cm/week faster and had lower (approximately 35%) foliar amino acid concentrations than plants in the field. Aphids affected plant growth differently depending on growing environment; they promoted plant growth by 18-37% in tunnels, although they had no such effect in the field. Aphids reduced total and essential amino acid concentrations, with SRA causing greatest reductions (approximately 40% and 33%, respectively). Aphid population sizes were similar in both environments, although individual LRA were smaller in tunnels (30% smaller in 2007) compared with those in the field. We suggest that faster aphid development rates inside warmer tunnels were not realized as a result of the variable effects of the growing environment on amino acid composition. We conclude that the increasing use of protected environments in crop production will not necessarily cause predictable increases in aphid populations, although it may alter aphid-plant interactions in terms of aphid-induced changes to plant growth.  2011 The Authors.

Here, we test how phylogenetic relatedness, tradeoffs, trait syndromes, and sexual reproduction affect the macroevolution of defense. To examine the macroevolution of defenses, we studied 26 Oenothera (Onagraceae) species, combining chemistry, comparative phylogenetics and experimental assays of resistance against generalist and specialist herbivores. We detected dozens of phenolic metabolites within leaves, including ellagitannins (ETs), flavonoids, and caffeic acid derivatives (CAs). The concentration and composition of phenolics exhibited low to moderate phylogenetic signal. There were clear negative correlations between multiple traits, supporting the prediction of allocation tradeoffs. There were also positively covarying suites of traits, but these suites did not strongly predict resistance to herbivores and thus did not act as defensive syndromes. By contrast, specific metabolites did correlate with the performance of generalist and specialist herbivores. Finally, that repeated losses of sex in Oenothera was associated with the evolution of increased flavonoid diversity and altered phenolic composition. These results show that secondary chemistry has evolved rapidly during the diversification of Oenothera. This evolution has been marked by allocation tradeoffs between traits, some of which are related to herbivore performance. The repeated loss of sex appears also to have constrained the evolution of plant secondary chemistry, which may help to explain variation in defense among plants.  2014 The Authors.

Plant pollinator interactions play a prominent role in the evolution of reproductive traits in flowering plants. Likewise, plant herbivore interactions select for myriad defenses that protect plants from damage. These mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, respectively, have traditionally been considered in isolation from one another. Here, we consider whether reproductive traits and antiherbivore defenses are interdependent as a result of pollinator- and herbivore-mediated selection. The evolution of floral traits, self-fertilization, and separate sexes frequently affects the expression and evolution of plant defenses. In turn, the evolution of defense can affect allocation to reproductive traits, and herbivores often impose strong selection directly on floral traits. Theory and empirical evidence suggest that herbivores can intluence the evolution of selling from outcrossing and potentially the evolution of separate sexes from combined sexes. We identify several areas in which future research is needed to increase our understanding of the evolutionary interplay between reproduction and defense in plants.",141,2

In this review, we synthesise information about four key ecological mechanisms occurring in the rhizosphere or surrounding soil that confer plant protection against root herbivores. We focus on root tolerance, root resistance via direct physical and chemical defences, particularly via acquisition of silicon-based plant defences, integration of plant mutualists (microbes and entomopathogenic nematodes, EPNs) and the influence of soil history and feedbacks. Their suitability as management tools, current limitations for their application, and the opportunities for development are evaluated. We identify opportunities for synergy between these aspects of rhizosphere ecology, such as mycorrhizal fungi negatively affecting pests at the root-interface but also increasing plant uptake of silicon, which is also known to reduce herbivory.

Therefore, it is important to determine whether common ecological stressors induce similar changes in flowering time. We review previous studies to determine whether two important stressors, water restriction and herbivory, induce consistent flowering time responses among species; for example, how often do water restriction and herbivory both delay flowering? We focus on the direction of change in flowering time, which affects the potential for divergence in heterogeneous environments. We also tested whether these stressors influenced time to flowering and nonphenology traits using Mimulus guttatus. The literature review suggests that water restriction has variable effects on flowering time, whereas herbivory delays flowering with exceptional consistency. In the Mimulus experiment, low water and herbivory advanced and delayed flowering, respectively. Overall, our results temper theoretical predictions for evolutionary divergence due to habitat-induced changes in flowering time; in particular, we discuss how accounting for variation in the direction of change in flowering time can either increase or decrease the potential for divergence. In addition, we caution against adaptive interpretations of stress-induced phenology shifts.  2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",144,2

This relationship tended to be weaker for seed predation than for other types of herbivory, except when seed predation rates were very high. Even so, the amount by which studies reduced herbivory was a poor predictor of differences in population growth rateswhich strongly cautions against using measured herbivory rates as a proxy for the impact of herbivores.

Rapid plant growth often results in poorly defended nutrient-rich foliage, which is more susceptible to foliar-chewing herbivores. It is less known how other guilds of arthropods are affected by plant regrowth. We tested the hypotheses that clipping-induced resprouting and nutrient availability, separately and in combination, would (1) influence plant traits, (2) benefit chewing herbivores, sapsuckers, gallers, and pre-dispersal seed predators, and (3) cascade up to the third trophic level by positively affecting herbivores. Resprouted plants were morphologically and phenologically different from undamaged plants; as a result, seed predation, infestation rate, richness, and diversity of seed predators increased, and species composition was altered. Leaf consumption by chewing herbivores was four times higher on resprouted plants. The number of galls decreased, whereas the abundance of sap-sucking and leaf-chewing insects was not affected. The incidence of predators and parasitoids was also higher on resprouted plants and on plants with nutrients added, but the increase was less pronounced compared to the herbivores they feed on.

In the field surveys, we assessed the effects of vertebrate herbivory (""topping"") and invertebrate leaf herbivory on plant size and fecundity and compared observed levels of herbivory across sites with different disturbance histories (scrub vs. roadside; scrub sites with differing time-since-fire). In the herbivore exclusion experiment, we compared the effects on plant size and fecundity of excluding vertebrate herbivores (toppers) only vs. excluding both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. We found that 62% of plants in the survey had one or more topped stems and that topping occurred more frequently in recently burned sites (< 8 years since fire vs. > 14 years since fire) and in scrub than in roadside sites. Topped plants were significantly shorter and had a greater number of stems (untopped plants only produced 1 stem). Topped plants were less likely to flower, began flowering later in the growing season, and produced fewer inflorescences, infructescences, achenes, and full achenes than untopped plants. Fifty-two percent of surveyed L. ohlingerae plants also showed evidence of invertebrate leaf herbivory with a mean of 24% of leaves damaged. Plants damaged by invertebrate herbivores did not differ significantly in growth or reproduction compared with undamaged plants. In the experiment, exclusion of vertebrate herbivores resulted in taller plants, fewer stems, higher flowering frequency, earlier first flowering, and greater production of inflorescences, infructescences, achenes, and full achenes per plant; plants gained no additional benefits when invertebrates were excluded. Our study demonstrates that L. ohlingerae partially compensates for vertebrate herbivore damage at some sites, depending on the disturbance history. There are population level consequences of undercompensation; vertebrate topping resulted in a 30% reduction in mean fecundity. Future research is necessary to determine if undercompensation jeopardizes the long-term persistence of L. ohlingerae populations.",148,2

The effect of water deficiency on aphid performance was also evaluated. Brassica napus plants were provided with either continuous water (well-watered) or were watered only once per week (water-deficient). The plants were exposed to either B. brassicae, L. erysimi, or no aphids at all. Aphid population increase, plant growth, and water relations were measured after 3 weeks. Water deficiency reduced plant growth and altered water relations in B. napus. Feeding by the aphid L. erysimi substantially reduced growth of both water-deficient and well-watered B. napus. However, herbivory by B. brassicae reduced plant growth only in conjunction with water limitation, demonstrating an interaction between limited water and insect infestation on the performance of B. napus. The aphid species and water deficiency treatments also differentially affected turgor potential, osmotic potential, leaf water potential, and leaf water content. The two species of aphids responded differently to changes in their host plants. The average size and numbers of B. brassicae aphids were lower but the percentage of alates was higher on plants with limited water relative to those on well-watered plants. The average size and numbers of L. erysimi aphids were unaffected by water limitation and the percentage of alates produced was slightly reduced in the water-deficient plants. Water limitation is likely to reduce the growth of plants, particularly when B. brassicae infests the crop. However, L. erysimi is probably the more serious pest of the two aphids in that it reduced plant growth regardless of watering regime and its development was unaffected by the status of the host plant.

A companion experiment investigated damage responses under controlled greenhouse conditions and identified possible mechanisms of compensation. The study species frequently experience apical meristem removal in nature. Per-individual damage-rate estimates ranged from 33-54% in L. rigidum and from 12-24% in L. sulcatum. Both species compensate substantially in mature height, branch number and biomass under field conditions. Compensation in the greenhouse tended to be incomplete, perhaps because the greenhouse experiment may have failed to simulate natural conditions and ended before maximum sizes had been reached.

We performed a meta-analysis of 434 studies spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in responses of plant-fungal symbioses to future environments. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change?

In all global change scenarios, except elevated CO2, fungal symbionts significantly altered plant responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of multiple fungal symbioses.

Examining Central European field populations of 22 species of short-lived monocarpic herbs exposed to various sources of damage, we hypothesized that: (1) with increasing injury severity, the number of axillary branches would decrease, due to axillary meristem limitation, whereas the number of adventitious shoots (typically induced by severe injury) would increase; (2) favorable environmental conditions would allow intact plants to branch more, resulting in stronger axillary meristem limitation than in unfavorable conditions; and (3) consequently, adventitious sprouting would be better enabled in favorable than unfavorable conditions. We found strong support for the first hypothesis, only limited support for the second, and none for the third. Our results imply that whereas soil nutrients and competition marginally influence plant tolerance to damage, potential bud banks enable plants to overcome meristem limitation from severe damage, and therefore better tolerate it.

Aspect explained about one-third of the environmental variation in species distributions. In flat areas, spatial variation in species composition varied with grazing intensity at two scales. At a coarse scale (among vegetation patches), grazing promoted patchiness, and among-transect variation in species diversity and grazing intensity were positively correlated. At a fine scale (within vegetation patches), the disruption of the self-organizing processes of the species spatial distributions resulted in a reduction in the long-range spatial autocorrelations of some of the characteristic species and in the homogenization of species spatial distributions. The presence of encroaching Echinospartum horridum had a significant influence on the effect of grazing on south-facing grassland slopes.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",155,2

This study explored the effects of industrial pollution on leaf damage by insect herbivores (primarily defoliators) in two willow species, Salix myrsinifolia and S. caprea, growing naturally at different distances from two nickel-copper smelters (Harjavalta, SW Finland and Monchegorsk, NW Russia). The relationships between pollution load and herbivory were variable, from significantly positive to significantly negative. However, this variation was not related to the differences between polluters, willow species or study years; an overall effect of pollution on herbivory, as evaluated by meta-analysis of 12 individual data sets, did not differ from zero. This result hints that an overall increase in insect herbivory with industrial pollution, discovered in meta-analysis of published observational studies, may be an artefact caused by research and publication biases.  2015, Finnish Environment Institute, All Rights Reserved.",156,2

Acer pseudoplatanus L. and Fraxinus excelsior L. are broadleaved tree species that are preferentially browsed by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in central Europe. We analyzed growth data from shaded saplings of both tree species to quantify the extent to which height growth after game browsing is reduced in subsequent, unbrowsed years in forest stands. Sixty saplings of F. excelsior and A. pseudoplatanus from forest stands at Albisriederberg (Switzerland) were available to us that had been dissected into pieces that then were split in the middle for counting tree rings and assessing ungulate damage. We fitted the von Bertalanffy growth equation to these height growth data and included a reduction factor for winter browsing. Both tree species showed significantly reduced height growth in unbrowsed years after one to several browsing events in winter, and this effect increased with the number of browsing events. Saplings with a high growth rate showed a higher growth reduction. After winter browsing, height growth of A. pseudoplatanus saplings was less affected in unbrowsed years than that of F. excelsior saplings. We conclude that browsed saplings of these species in forest stands are not able to compensate browsing-induced height loss, but that height differences between browsed and unbrowsed saplings probably increase over time. A comparison between our analysis and the parameters estimated using equations published by Eiberle for predicting age at 130 cm height suggests that our parameter values are rather conservative estimates of the growth reduction effect after winter browsing. Neither F. excelsior nor A. pseudoplatanus show a distinct pattern in browsing-induced growth reduction with respect to soil moisture, nutrient level, and altitude. We thus conclude that our results are likely to be valid for a wide range of forested sites.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",157,2

In this study, the combined effects of light availability and timing of browsing on the response of 9-year-old Abies alba saplings were tested experimentally. Leader shoot clipping was applied before budburst, shortly after budburst or in autumn on saplings grown in full light or under artificial shade. Timing of clipping, light availability and tree vigour (expressed as height and tree ring width before clipping) had an effect on the height after clipping. After clipping in autumn or before budburst, fast-growing fir saplings bent up twigs to form new leader shoots and overcompensated height loss; saplings characterised by intermediate growth rates formed new shoots out of regular visible lateral buds; and slow-growing saplings had no new shoot in the first year after clipping, such that the clipping-induced height difference even increased over time. Saplings clipped shortly after budburst elongated the remaining part of the shoot in the first year and developed shoots out of the most distal lateral buds in the second growing season, leading to complete height compensation. Multi-trunking was typical for all clipped trees. We conclude that the microscale conditions under which a tree is growing (i. e. which affect tree vigour) are highly important for determining whether the height reduction imposed by browsing is offset by overcompensation or increases over time relative to unclipped trees. This response can partly be influenced by forest management via enhancing tree vigour via the light regime.  2012 Springer-Verlag.",158,2

Thus, ungulate browsing is a common phenomenon on Central European tree species. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to how exactly leader shoot browsing affects plant performance. The response to browsing is complex but typically a tree survives. In this review, six key factors are discussed that mainly determine the response after a browsing event of the leader shoot: (1) different places of reserve storage by deciduous vs. evergreen trees, (2) growth pattern with true vs. pseudoterminal buds (mono- vs. sympodially branching trees) and orthotropic vs. plagiotropic growth forms of shoots (cf. architectural models by RAUH, MASSART or TROLL), (3) the ontogenetic stage of the tree, (4) 'stress status' determined by site conditions such as light, water and nutrient availability, thermal energy, competition by other trees and ground-vegetation, as well as stress exerted by fungi and herbivory, (5) timing of browsing, and (6) intensity and frequency of browsing. Specifically, I propose non-linear relationships between the 'stress status' of a tree seedling/sapling and its height compensation, above-ground biomass compensation, and basal diameter increment after browsing. The tree's 'stress status' and the time of browsing are key determinants whether the height reduction induced by browsing (i) is offset by enhanced height growth, (ii) leads to a constant height difference compared to unbrowsed trees, or (iii) becomes larger over time. Thus, based on the six factors proposed here, a wide range of tree reactions to ungulate browsing can be explained and predicted. Knowing the reaction of trees, the impact of ungulates on tree regeneration and hence on forest succession can be estimated for different forest types.  2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In particular, we focused on Borneo ironwood (Eusideroxylon zwageri, Lauraceae), which seemed to employ an extreme defensive strategy. The wood of this species is extremely durable and has a high specific gravity with a very slow growth rate. The allocation to defense by Borneo ironwood was compared to two emergent species of Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family in this forest community. We conducted shade-house experiments on seedlings under four controlled conditions (two light levels x two nutrient levels) and showed that the growth rate of E. zwageri was much lower than those of the other two species, and it allocated more of its net production to leaves and roots than to stems. The concentrations of condensed tannins and lignins were very high in the leaves and stems of this species, at about 20 and 30%, respectively. In total, E. zwageri allocated a maximum of about 35% of its net production to defensive substances (i.e., condensed tannins + lignins). In contrast, the two dipterocarp species allocated about 20-25% of their net production to defensive substances. The condensed tannins in E. zwageri help to prolong the lifespan of the leaves, and the lignins in the stems enhance the durability of the wood. Thus, although E. zwageri grows very slowly, the allocation to defensive substances seems to be an advantageous strategy for survival under dark conditions.  Springer-Verlag 2004.",160,2

The variance of an effect size is typically a function of sampling error; however, it can also be influenced by study design.

Their effect can be, in turn, modulated by biotic or abiotic factors such as community composition, habitat characteristics or space heterogeneity. Recent approaches to the study of herbivore and granivore impacts on plants have considered the combined action of multiple herbivore species, the effect of herbivores on several plant life stages or the effect of environmental gradients on these interactions. However, studies addressing the effect of multiple herbivore species on different plant life stages are still lacking. We estimated the combined effect of multiple exotic herbivores (European rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus; black rats, Rattus rattus; and house mouse, Mus musculus) on four different life stages of an endangered plant species (Medicago citrina, Fabaceae). Mortality for seed, seedling and sapling was estimated at three types of plots (open, rat exclusion and rat+rabbit exclusion) replicated at four sites (N=3 per site and treatment) within Cabrera Island (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean). Browsing of reproductive adults was simulated under common-garden conditions (Sller Botanic Garden, Mallorca Island) and its effect on reproductive effort and success measured. European rabbits and black rats had complementary impacts on the different life stages of M. citrina. These included independent effects on different life stages (seed predation by rats, seedling predation by rabbits), which resulted in multiplicative increases in plant mortality, and concurrent effects on the same life stage (sapling predation). In addition, the simulated-herbivory experiment showed that a low rate of canopy removal (25% of initial biomass) already causes a strong decrease in fruit set (from 54% to 30%), but increasing rates of canopy removal do not increase this effect. Synthesis. Our results stress the importance of considering the combined effects of different herbivores on several life stages of the plant's life cycle and their consecutive effects on population dynamics. From an applied point of view, future reintroduction attempts of M.citrina in Cabrera Island should consider measures to either control the populations of both exotic herbivores or mitigate their impacts on the earlier recruitment stages of the plant (seeds, seedlings and saplings).  2012 The Authors.

These environmental changes also can affect plants indirectly by altering interactions with other species. Therefore, the effects of global changes on a particular species may depend on the presence and abundance of other community members. We experimentally manipulated atmospheric CO2 concentration and amounts of herbivore damage (natural insect folivory and clipping to simulate browsing) to examine: (1) how herbivores mediate the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis thaliana; and (2) how predicted changes in CO2 concentration affect plant resistance to herbivores, which influences the amount of damage plants receive, and plant tolerance of herbivory, or the fitness consequences of damage. We found no evidence that CO2 altered resistance, but plants grown in eCO2 were less tolerant of herbivory-clipping reduced aboveground biomass and fruit production by 13 and 22%, respectively, when plants were reared under eCO2, but plants fully compensated for clipping in ambient CO2 (aCO2) environments. Costs of tolerance in the form of reduced fitness of undamaged plants were detected in eCO2 but not aCO2 environments. Increased costs could reduce selection on tolerance in eCO2 environments, potentially resulting in even larger fitness effects of clipping in predicted future eCO2 conditions. Thus, environmental perturbations can indirectly affect both the ecology and evolution of plant populations by altering both the intensity of species interactions as well as the fitness consequences of those interactions.

More specifically, this paper attempts to measure key variables of RFID adoption derived from Rogers' innovation theory and further examines how state intervention influences the process of RFD adoption. First, this paper compares, relying on a meta-analysis, various mean effect sizes among technological, organizational and environmental factors (i.e. government-driven policies) that Rogers suggested in his innovation model. Design/methodology/approach - In mean effect size analysis, this paper finds that the technological factor is the most powerful factor that affects the RFID adoption. The technological factor is statistically significant across all regions, including North America, Europe and Asia. The organizational factor is significant only in developing countries like Southeast Asian countries and East Asian countries. Environmental factors like government intervention for facilitating RFID adoption are strong enough only in Southeast Asia and Europe. Findings - This paper finds that government's supportive policy is more effective in Europe but not in America, while external pressure is still more effective in Southeast Asia. These results implicate that developmentalism or government-driven policy can be effective not only in developing countries but also in the case of developed countries. In addition, this paper conducts a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis based on Fisher's standardized score. Originality/value - In SUR analysis, this paper finds that the correlations between RFID adoption intention and three innovation factors vary across industrial areas. More specifically, the manufacturing area shows negative moderating effect on all three equations where correlations between Rogers' innovation factors and RFID adoption intention are meta-dependent variables. Also, RFD adoption is accelerated when the size of the firm is large or the location of the firm is in Southeast Asia. This result implicates that the aspect of technology adoption can be changed by region and type of industry.",165,1

Plants were grown in ambient and nitrogen-enhanced conditions in both communities. Nitrogen additions produced an average 12% initial increase in leaf number of all plants. By the end of the experiment, invasive species outperformed native species in nitrogen-enhanced plots in hardwood forests, where all plants experienced increased damage relative to control plots. Native species experienced higher overall amounts of damage in hardwood forests, losing, on average, 45% more leaves than exotic species, and only native species experienced a decline in growth rates (32% compared with controls). In contrast, in pine barrens, there were no differences in damage and no differences in performance between native and invasive plants. Our results suggest that unequal damage by natural enemies may play a role in determining community composition by shifting the competitive advantage to exotic species in nitrogen-enhanced environments.

Undamaged plants, on the other hand, often restrain branching, and this limitation on growth can be considered a cost of tolerance to herbivory. Restrained branching is caused by apical dominance and may, alternatively, be associated with fitness benefits in competitive environments that favor fast vertical growth. To test these hypotheses regarding selection for restrained branching, we compared the performance of two subspecies of the biennial grassland herb Gentianella campestris; the tall, apically dominant ssp. campestris and the short, multi-stemmed ssp. islandica, which shows reduced apical dominance. For both subspecies, we manipulated the height of surrounding vegetation (competition) and damage intensity in grasslands of differing productivity (high, medium, low), and examined population growth rates using matrix population models combined with life table response experiments. In the absence of damage, ssp. campestris exhibited a higher population growth rate than ssp. islandica in the tallest vegetation, however with the growth rate still being below one. In the medium and low productivity environments where the vegetation was shorter, the population growth rate of ssp. islandica was considerably higher than that of ssp. campestris as long as no more than about 50% of the plants were damaged. When plants were damaged, the apically dominant ssp. campestris showed a positive population growth rate (>1) and often overcompensatory seed production in all productivity levels, while ssp. islandica showed no compensation and therefore the population was predicted to decline (<1). We conclude that restrained branching in Gentianella cannot be selected for by competition alone, but that episodes of apical damage are required to maintain the trait. Furthermore, because of the costs of restrained branching, apical dominance should be selected against in grasslands where competition and disturbance are low.  2017 by the Ecological Society of America",167,2

It is assumed that biological control agents will reduce the dominance of the target weed, thereby increasing the native diversity of the associated plant community. However, this hypothesis has rarely been tested. We introduced Aphthona nigriscutis into grassland sites infested with the invasive exotic species Euphorbia esula L. on a nature reserve in Montana (U.S.A.). Two sites with better soil had been treated previously with herbicide, whereas two other sites had not. We measured the density and biomass of Euphorbia vegetative and flowering stems and number of native and exotic shrubs, grass-like plants, and forbs in 48 microptots in Aphthona release and control macroplots at each site. After 5 years, Aphthona release was associated with a 33-39% decline in Euphorbia aboveground biomass compared with controls at all sites. Other effects of the biocontrol depended on the site. Biocontrol slowed the recovery of species diversity at the sites previously treated with herbicide but slowed the loss of diversity at sites without a history of herbicide. Biocontrol introduction was not associated with a disproportionate increase in nontarget exotic species. Release of Aphthona caused a decline in the biomass of flowering stems relative to controls at good-soil, previous-herbicide sites but was associated with a relative increase in flower stem mass at poor-soil, noherbicide sites. Our results suggest that biocontrol reductions in weed dominance will not always be associated with increased species diversity.

In a landscape experiment that manipulated connectivity, fragment shape, and distance to edge while holding fragment area constant, we examined how fragmentation impacts herbivory and growth of nine plant species in longleaf pine savanna. Probability of herbivory in open habitat was strongly dependent on proximity to forest edge for every species, increasing with distance to edge in six species (primarily grasses and annual forbs) and decreasing in three species (perennial forbs and a shrub). In the two species of perennial forbs, these edge effects were dependent on fragment shape; herbivory strongly decreased with distance to edge in fragments of two shapes, but not in a third shape. For most species, however, probability of herbivory was unrelated to connectivity or fragment shape. Growth was generally determined more strongly by leaf herbivory than by distance to edge, fragment shape, or connectivity. Taken together, these results demonstrate consistently strong edge effects on herbivory, one of the most important biotic factors determining plant growth and demography.

One particular aspect of tolerance, compensatory responses, can evolve rapidly in plant species; providing insight into interactions between consumers and plants. However, compensation by invasive species has rarely been explored. We compared compensatory responses to the effects of simulated herbivory expressed by plants from seven Solidago gigantea populations from the native North American range to that expressed by plants from nine populations from the nonnative European range. Populations were also collected along elevational gradients to compare ecotypic variation within and between ranges. Solidago plants from the nonnative range of Europe were more tolerant to herbivory than plants from the native range of North America. Furthermore, plants from European populations increased in total biomass and growth rate with elevation, but decreased in compensatory response. There were no relationships between elevation and growth or compensation for North American populations. Our results suggest that Solidago gigantea may have evolved to better compensate for herbivory damage in Europe, perhaps in response to a shift to greater proportion of attack from generalists.

We identify and review three different indirect interactions, which play important roles for periphyton-grazer interactions in benthic food webs. These are keystone predation, trophic cascading and habitat facilitation. Direct negative effects were stronger than indirect positive effect, because grazing leads in almost all studies to a decrease in algal biomass.

Because tolerance and defence against herbivory differ with the ontogeny of a plant, the effects of herbivore damage on plant fitness vary with ontogenetic stage and are compounded throughout a plant's lifetime. Environmental stresses such as light and nutrient limitations can further influence the response of the plant. Much is known about the response of plants in the seedling and reproductive adult stages, but less attention has been given to the pre-reproductive juvenile stage.MethodsJuvenile plants of the North American invasive Lonicera maackii were exposed to simulated herbivory under high and low light and nitrogen availability and growth, allocation patterns and foliar defensive chemistry were measured. In a second experiment, complete nutrient availability and damage type (generalist caterpillar or simulated) were manipulated.Key ResultsJuvenile plants receiving 50 % defoliation had lower total biomass and a higher root^:^shoot ratio than controls for all treatment combinations except low nitrogen/low light. Low light and defoliation increased root^:^shoot ratio. Light, fertilization and defoliation had little impact on foliar defensive chemistry. In the second experiment, there was a reduction in total biomass when caterpillar damage was applied. The root^:^shoot ratio increased under low soil fertility and was not affected by defoliation. Stem-diameter growth rates and specific leaf area did not vary by damage type or fertilization. Foliar protein increased through time, and more strongly in defoliated plants than in controls, while peroxidase activity and total flavonoids decreased with time. Overall, resource limitations were more influential than damage in the growth of juvenile L. maackii plants.ConclusionsThe findings illustrate that even when resources are limited, the tolerance and defence against herbivory of a woody invasive plant in the juvenile stage may contribute to the establishment and persistence of some species in a variety of habitats.

Models predict both increased and decreased tolerance with increasing resources. Transgenerational effects of herbivory may result in cross-generation tolerance. We evaluated within- and potential between-generation consequences of deer browsing in light-gap and understory habitats in the forest-edge herb, Campanulastrum americanum. Plants were assigned to deer-browsed, simulated-herbivory, and control (undamaged) treatments in the two light environments. In light gaps, plants were eaten earlier, more frequently, and had less vegetative recovery relative to uneaten plants than in the understory. As a result, browsed light-gap plants had a greater reduction in flowers and fruit than understory plants. This reduced tolerance was in part because deer browsing damaged plants in light gaps more than those in the understory. However, in the simulated herbivory treatment, where damage levels were similar between light habitats, plants growing in high-resource light gaps also had reduced tolerance of herbivory relative to those in the forest understory. C. americanum's reproductive phenology was delayed by reduced light and the loss of the apical meristem. As a result, deer-browsed plants in the light gap flowered slightly later than uneaten plants in the understory. C. americanum has a polymorphic life history and maternal flowering time influences the frequency of annual and biennial offspring. The later flowering of deer-browsed plants in light gaps will likely result in a reduced frequency of high-fitness annual offspring and an increase in lower fitness biennial offspring. Therefore, additional between-generation costs of herbivory are expected relative to those predicted by fruit number alone.  Springer-Verlag 2010.",173,2

The competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4years within plant life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.  2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",174,2

This review paper focuses on this issue for oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., a species that produces huge numbers of pollen grains and seeds. We analyze separately the distinct steps of gene flow: (1) pollen and seeds as vectors of gene flow; (2) spontaneous hybridization; (3) hybrid behavior, fitness cost due to hybridization and mechanisms of introgression; (4) and fitness benefit due to transgenes (e.g. herbicide resistance and Bt toxin). Some physical, biological and molecular means of transgene containment are also described.Although hybrids and first generation progeny are difficult to identify in fields and non-crop habitats, the literature shows that transgenes could readily introgress into Brassica rapa, Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea, while introgression is expected to be rare with Brassica nigra, Hirschfeldia incana and Raphanus raphanistrum. The hybrids grow well but produce less seed than their wild parent. The difference declines with increasing generations. However, there is large uncertainty about the evolution of chromosome numbers and recombination, and many parameters of life history traits of hybrids and progeny are not determined with satisfactory confidence to build generic models capable to really cover the wide diversity of situations. We show that more studies are needed to strengthen and organize biological knowledge, which is a necessary prerequisite for model simulations to assess the practical and evolutionary outputs of introgression, and to provide guidelines for gene flow management.  2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",175,2

However, few studies help predict the impact on the population dynamics. To simulate the performance of introgressed insect-resistant plants of wild Brassica juncea, independently from the interspecific hybridization cost, healthy plants were cultivated in pure and mixed stands with damaged plants through cutting leaves in field experiments over two field seasons. As expected, resistant (healthy) plants held a competitive advantage when in competition with susceptible (damaged) plants. Individual biomass and seed production of both types of plants decreased as the percentage of resistant plants increased, so that the relative advantage of resistant plants increased. The combined effects of defoliation and competition on the individual performance of B. juncea were additive. Replacement series experiments confirmed this trend but did not show different seed output in pure stand of susceptible versus resistant plots. The total vegetative and reproductive production of mixed populations was not significantly different of that of pure populations. These results suggest that if a transgene for insect-resistance were to colonize wild populations, high herbivory of susceptible plant and low resource availability would facilitate the spread of resistant individuals. However, at the population level, the shift from an insect-susceptible to a predominantly resistant population would not result in exacerbated habitat colonization.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",176,2

Transgenic and non-transgenic plants are likely to coexist in the field and natural habitats, but their competitive interactions are not well understood. Methods: Field experiments were conducted in an agricultural ecosystem with insecticide spraying and a natural ecosystem, using Bt-transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) and its non-transgenic counterpart in pure and mixed stands with a replacement series. Results: Insect damage and competition significantly decreased plant growth and reproduction under the coexistence of transgenic and conventional rice. Insect-resistant transgenic rice was not competitively superior to its counterpart under different densities in both agricultural and natural ecosystems, irrespective of insect infection. Fitness cost due to Bt-transgene expression occurred only in an agroecosystem, where the population yield decreased with increasing percentage of transgenic rice. The population yield fluctuated in a natural ecosystem, with slight differences among pure and mixed stands under plant competition or insect pressure. The presence of Chilo suppressalis infection increased the number of non-target insects. Conclusions: Plant growth and reproduction patterns, relative competition ability and population yield indicate that Bt-transgenic and non-transgenic rice can coexist in agroecosystems, whereas in more natural habitats, transgenic rice is likely to outcompete non-transgenic rice.

The second backcrossed generation (BC2) from a single backcross family was grown in pure and mixed stands of Bt-transgenic and non-transgenic siblings under two insect treatments. Various proportions of Bt-transgenic plants were employed in mixed stands to study the interaction between resistant and susceptible plants. In the pure stands, Bt-transgenic BC2 plants performed better than non-transgenic plants with or without insect treatments. In mixed stands, Bt-transgenic BC2 plants produced fewer seeds than their non-Bt counterparts at low proportions of Bt-transgenic BC2 plants in the absence of insects. Reproductive allocation of non-transgenic plants marginally increased with increasing proportions of Bt-transgenic plants under herbivore pressure, which resulted in increased total biomass and seed production per stand. The results showed that the growth of non-transgenic plants was protected by Bt-transgenic plants under herbivore pressure. The Bt-transgene might not be advantageous in mixed stands of backcrossed hybrids; thus transgene introgression would not be facilitated when herbivorous insects are not present.

Methods: We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we grew the creeping, perennial herb Hydrocotyle vulgaris in two soil treatments (homogeneous and heterogeneous) with or without the aphid Myzus persicae and with or without the earthworm Eisenia fetida. Results: H. vulgaris grew more in heterogeneous than in homogeneous soil, even though total nutrient availability was held constant, and less with than without aphids. The presence of aphids decreased plant growth less in both the high- and the low-nutrient patches in the heterogeneous soil treatment than in the medium-nutrient soil in the homogeneous soil treatment.

Because the selection of tree species and sites when establishing plantation forests has potential effects on subsequent damage by pests, there is need for consideration of joint effects of tree species, site quality, and risk of pests. We tested here how site quality influences the response of two pines species that differ in their evolutionary history with a primary pest in the system. Our specific research objectives were to (1) measure the growth response of two pine species (the native Pinus pinaster and the introduced P. radiata) to defoliation by the pine processionary moth, across a gradient of nutrient availability and (2) compare the constitutive and delayed defoliation induced chemical defenses of these two pine species on sites of low and high quality. We analyzed variation in foliar nitrogen, terpenes, tannins, total phenols and four defensive proteins. The impact on tree growth from experimentally applied defoliation by PPM was surprisingly low. Even with complete defoliation, large sample sizes, and baseline measurements that accounted for much of the variation among trees, we observed only modest effects on diameter growth and no effects on height growth; volume growth was initially reduced by only 68% initially, with full recovery within 3 years of defoliation. Pinus radiata, the faster growing species, had higher concentrations than P. pinaster of foliar N while P. pinaster had up to 12 times higher concentrations of terpenes, these results match with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis (RAH). Pinus radiata foliage was relatively rich in tannins and total phenolics. The pine species also differed in defensive proteins. Pinuspinaster had higher concentrations of peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and chitinase (CHI), while P. radiata had higher concentrations of trypsin inhibitor (TI). Finally there was no evidence for delayed inducible defenses in either pine species following PPM defoliation; both species seem to use other defensive strategies to counter predictable attacks by the herbivore. In our study region, defoliation by PPM may not be a primary consideration in the selection of pine species for production forests, but this conclusion need not hold in regions where pines grow more slowly or are exposed to multiple years of defoliation by PPM.  2016 Elsevier B.V.",182,2

The consequences of these stressors will depend, in part, upon the ability of plants to compensate for herbivory. Previous studies found that herbivore impacts on plants can vary from negative to positive because of environmental control of plant compensatory responses, a.k.a. the Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis. While these influential studies enhanced our appreciation of the dynamic nature of plant-herbivore interactions, they largely focused on the impact of resource limitation. This bias limits our ability to predict how other environmental factors will shape the impact of herbivory. We examined the role of salinity stress on herbivory of salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, by an herbivore previously hypothesized to influence the success of restoration projects (the scale insect, Haliaspis spartinae). Using a combination of field and mesocosm manipulations of scales and salinity, we measured how these factors affected Spartina growth and timing of senescence. In mesocosm studies, Spartina overcompensated for herbivory by growing taller shoots at low salinities but the impact of scales on plants switched from positive to neutral with increasing salinity stress. In field studies of intermediate salinities, scales reduced Spartina growth and increased the rate of senescence. Experimental salinity additions at this field site returned the impact of scales to neutral. Because salinity decreased scale densities, the switch in impact of scales on Spartina with increasing salinity was not simply a linear function of scale abundance. Thus, the impact of scales on primary production depended strongly upon environmental context because intermediate salinity stress prevented plant compensatory responses to herbivory. Understanding this context-dependency will be required if we are going to successfully predict the success of restoration efforts and the ecological consequences of anthropogenic disturbances. 2014 Long Porturas.",183,2

However, little is known about functional and demographic resilience (extent and speed of recovery) of plants subjected to varying levels of chronic defoliation. 2.We used a dioecious, understorey palm (Chamaedorea elegans) to evaluate temporal trajectories and rates of recovery of leaf functional traits and vital rates (survival, growth and reproduction) after being subjected to experimental chronic defoliation regimes. 3.Pristine populations of mature C. elegans, categorized by gender (male and female), were subjected to five defoliation levels (0%, 33%, 50%, 66% or 100% of newly produced leaves) every 6months over a period of 3years (1997-2000). To evaluate recovery from defoliation, surviving palms were monitored for 3years after the cessation of the defoliation treatment (2000-2003). We recorded leaf functional traits (leaf persistence, leaf production rate, leaf size and leaf area) and annual rates of mortality, growth and reproduction. 4.Cumulative effects of chronic defoliation concomitantly reduced leaf traits, survival, growth and reproduction, and this effect was stronger in female than in male palms, independent of plant size. Recovery from defoliation was faster in males than in females, but proceeded gradually overall. Survival increased first, followed by growth, while reproductive traits showed the slowest recovery rate. Recovery was independent of plant size. Notably, 3years after defoliation treatment, the standing leaf area and probability of reproduction had not recovered to pre-defoliation levels. Additionally, we found that the occurrence of a severe drought in the first year (2000) after defoliation ceased led to decreased survival, growth and reproduction and the ability of plants to recover from defoliation. 5.Synthesis.Chronic defoliation reduces fitness components of C. elegans palms differentially between genders. Recovery is gradual and is slower and less complete in females compared with males. The lower level of resilience to chronic defoliation shown by female plants may have profound consequences for the dynamics and genetic variability of populations of tropical understorey plants undergoing prolonged defoliation. Such effects may be aggravated by severe drought episodes that are expected to increase in frequency according to global climate change predictions. Experimental chronic defoliation over 3years, in Chamaedorea elegans palms reduced survival, growth, and reproduction depending on gender. After defoliation stopped, recovery of the vital rates observed over the following 3years was slower in females than males. This lower resilience may have profound long-lasting consequences for the dynamics and genetic variability of palm populations undergoing prolonged defoliation. Such effects may be aggravated by severe drought episodes caused by El Nio Southern-Oscillation events, which are expected to increase in frequency.  2012 British Ecological Society.",184,2

Determining the drivers of plant demography is integral to understanding the processes that shape plant species abundances and distributions. Despite recognition that interactions among drivers have important effects on demographic processes, few demographic studies test for interactions among multiple drivers in plants. 2.We used a factorial-design experiment to study the interactive effects among three common forms of disturbance in the tropics (fire history, grazing and leaf harvest by humans) on the vital rates of Phoenix loureiri (mountain date palm) in South India. In addition, we tested for interactive effects among these disturbances, abiotic conditions and plant size. We also tested for non-consumptive effects of grazing and harvest, such as trampling, by measuring the intensities of grazing and harvest in plots open to these disturbances. 3.Intensities of leaf harvest and grazing varied with abiotic conditions and disturbance. Leaf harvest decreased with increasing grazing intensity, suggesting that the net effect of harvest on palm populations is less where it co-occurs with grazing. In areas without fire, plots with lower soil moisture had higher grazing intensities. 4.We found multiple significant main and interactive effects of disturbance on palm vital rates. Palm mortality increased with fire and grazing. Grazing and harvest reduced growth, but growth increased following fire. The negative impact of harvest on palm individuals was reduced when harvest occurred in plots with fire. 5.We found evidence of non-consumptive effects of grazing and harvest on palm growth, likely from trampling. Studies inferring the effects of grazing by comparing grazed and ungrazed individuals within an area where grazing occurs will likely underestimate grazing effects. 6.Synthesis. Our findings reveal that P. loureiri demographic rates are driven by interactive effects among multiple forms of disturbance and abiotic factors and that the intensities of disturbance are themselves driven by interactions between other forms of disturbance and abiotic factors. These results illustrate that understanding the effects of, and interactions among, multiple drivers will be key in attempts to mitigate the effects of environmental change on plant species declines.

Methods: We conducted a fully factorial experiment with three factors: site (two levels), N fertilization (four levels) and disturbance (two levels). We measured treatment effects on understorey biomass, vegetation structure, and plant, soil and microbial N and C concentrations. Results: The understorey biomass was not affected by fertilization either in the control or in the disturbance treatment. Fertilization reduced the biomass of deciduous Vaccinium myrtillus. Disturbance had a negative effect on the biomass of V. myrtillus and evergreen Vaccinium vitis-idaea and decreased the relative proportion of evergreen species. Fertilization and disturbance increased the biomass of grass Deschampsia flexuosa and the relative proportion of graminoids. The amount of NH +4 increased in soil after fertilization, and microbial C decreased after disturbance. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the growth of slow-growing Vaccinium species and soil microbes in boreal forests are not limited by N availability. However, significant changes in the proportion of dwarf shrubs to graminoids and a decrease in the biomass of V. myrtillus demonstrate the susceptibility of understorey vegetation to N enrichment. N enrichment and disturbance seem to have similar effects on understorey vegetation. Consequently, increasing N does not affect the rate or the direction of recovery after disturbance. Moreover, our study demonstrates the importance of understorey vegetation as a C source for soil microbes in boreal forests.  2009 International Association for Vegetation Science.",190,2

Since environmental perturbations commonly occur in concert, there is a need for experimental investigations in which single, combined and interactive effects of environmental factors are studied. We studied interactive effects of N-fertilization (40 kg N ha-1year-1) and disturbance, i.e. removing the vegetation and soil organic layers, in the forest-tundra ecotone in northern Finland during 2002-2005. Plant abundances were measured in a coniferous forest, mountain birch forest and tundra heath. Both N-fertilization and disturbance reinforced the proportion of deciduous (Vaccinium myrtillus) and the graminoids (i.e. Deschampsia flexuosa and Carex sp.) at the expense of evergreens in vegetation. N-fertilization also enhanced the post-disturbance recovery of graminoids. Vegetation recovery was slow in the tundra heath, where N-fertilization decreased the abundance of the evergreen Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum. Although the changes in vegetation due to the N-fertilization and disturbance could be detected, they did not change the initial dominance of plant functional types. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing N affects the rate rather than direction of recovery after disturbance. Moreover, plant communities differ in terms of their capabilities to respond to multiple perturbations which should be taken into account when evaluating future vegetation responses under changing environment in at high-latitude and high-altitude ecosystems.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",191,2

Allocation costs and trade-offs between tolerance and plant chemical defenses may influence genetic variation for tolerance. However, variation in defenses also occurs for the presence or absence of discrete chemical structures; yet, the effects of intraspecific polymorphisms on tolerance to multiple herbivores have not been evaluated. Here, in a glasshouse experiment, we investigated the variation for tolerance to different types of herbivore damage, and direct allocation costs, in 10 genotypes of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), a wild relative of Arabidopsis, with contrasting foliar glucosinolate chemical structures (methionine-derived glucosinolates vs glucosinolates derived from branched-chain amino acids). We found significant genetic variation for tolerance to different types of herbivore. Structural variations in the glucosinolate profile did not influence tolerance to damage, but predicted plant fitness. Levels of constitutive and induced glucosinolates varied between genotypes with different structural profiles, but we did not detect any cost of tolerance explaining the genetic variation in tolerance among genotypes. Trade-offs between plant tolerance to multiple herbivores may not explain the existence of intermediate levels of tolerance to damage in plants with contrasting chemical defensive profiles.

Since the maintenance of mycorrhizal symbiosis implies a significant carbon cost for the host plant, the loss of photosynthetic leaf area due to herbivory is expected to reduce the host investment in mycorrhizae. We tested this hypothesis in a common garden experiment by exposing ectomycorrhizal white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings to simulated insect defoliation of 50 or 100% intensity during either the previous or the current summer or repeatedly during both seasons before harvest. The shoot and root growth of the seedlings were distinctly reduced by both 100% defoliation and repeated 50% defoliation, and they were more strongly affected by previous-year than current-year defoliation. The root to shoot ratio significantly decreased after 100% defoliation, indicating reduced proportional allocation to the roots. Ergosterol concentration (i.e. fungal biomass) in the fine roots decreased by 100% defoliation conducted either in the year of harvest or in both years. No such decrease occurred following the 100% defoliation conducted in the previous year, indicating the importance of current photosynthates for fungal symbionts. The trend was similar in the colonization percentage of thick-mantled mycorrhizae in the roots, the most marked decline occurring in the repeatedly defoliated seedlings. The present results thus support the prediction that the plant investment in ectomycorrhizae may decline as a response to foliage loss. Moreover, the colonization percentage of thick-mantled mycorrhizae correlated positively with the ratio of leaf to heterotrophic plant biomass in the defoliated birch seedlings, but not in the control ones. This tends to indicate a stronger carbon limitation of ectomycorrhizal colonization in defoliated seedlings.  Springer-Verlag 2004.",193,2

A fundamental goal of ecology is to predict how strongly one species affects the abundance of another. However, our ability to do so is hindered by the fact that interaction outcomes are notoriously variable in space and time (i.e. context-dependent) and we lack a predictive understanding of the factors that drive this context-dependence. Determining whether abiotic factors, in particular, predictably shift the outcome of species interactions is of critical importance for many contemporary problems, from forecasting climate change impacts to predicting the efficacy of weed biocontrol. 2. In this essay, we highlight the context-dependent nature of interactions between plants and their pollinators and herbivores. We advocate for approaches that will identify whether particular abiotic factors predictably shift how strongly these interactions influence plant abundance and/or population growth. We review long-standing theory that describes how abiotic context should influence the selective impacts of pollinators and herbivores on plants and articulate why this theory requires modification to predict population-level effects. 3. Finally, we propose several empirical approaches to address gaps in existing knowledge: (i) experiments across broad abiotic gradients to determine whether the outcome of interactions between pollinators or herbivores and plants varies consistently with changing abiotic conditions; (ii) experiments that manipulate the underlying environmental gradient to elucidate whether the abiotic factor that correlates with interaction outcome is causal; and (iii) seed addition studies to explore how strongly seedling recruitment correlates with seed input (as affected by pollen limitation or herbivory) and to quantify how the strength of the seed-to-seedling linkage is influenced by the underlying abiotic gradient. 4. Synthesis. Our understanding of the underlying drivers of context-dependent plant-animal interactions is currently not well developed. Progress in this area is essential to better predict when and where species interactions will alter the responses of plant populations to environmental changes as well as to develop more robust theory. Experiments aimed at explicitly exploring the role of abiotic factors in mediating the population-level impact of pollen limitation and herbivory could determine the extent to which variation in the abiotic environment predictably shifts the outcome of these interactions.  2014 The Authors.

In this study, we explored the effects of increased carbon and nutrient availability on the response of rapid cycling Brassica rapa to damage by the generalist herbivore, Trichoplusia ni (Noctuidae), in a greenhouse experiment. Using fruit mass as an estimate of plant fitness, we tested three physiological models, which predict either an increase or a decrease of tolerance to herbivory with increasing resource availability. We used leaf demography to examine some plausible mechanisms through which resource availability may affect tolerance. Our results contradict all models, and, rather, they support a more complicated view of the plasticity of resource uptake and allocation than the ones considered by the models tested. Fruit mass was negatively affected by herbivore damage only under elevated CO2, and only for certain harvest dates. Increased CO 2 had no effect on the number of leaf births, but it decreased leaf longevity and the total number of leaves on a plant. Nutrient addition increased the number of leaf births, leaf longevity and the total number of leaves on a plant. We conclude that a shortening of the life span of the plants, brought about by elevated CO2, was responsible for a higher susceptibility of plants to herbivore damage under high CO2 concentration.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",195,2

Because plant defenses, stored resources, and allocation demands change throughout a plant's lifetime, it can be hypothesized the effects of herbivory also vary with development. The present work extends previous analyses to incorporate hundreds of studies in a new meta-analysis addressing this topic. Herbivores had an overall negative effect on plant growth and reproduction, and, in contrast to a previous meta-analysis, this work shows the timing of herbivory is relevant. Differences in the effects of herbivory between life stages existed for woody plant reproduction and perennial herb growth. In addition, tree and shrub growth was reduced by herbivore damage at early ontogenetic stages, and perennial herb reproduction was limited by adult stage herbivory. These results partially support the continuum of an ontogenetic response model. Finally, consideration of this synthesis in conjunction with other work led to the conclusion that different plant groups optimize their defense investments in unique ways. Slow-growing plants may strongly chemically defend young tissues, supporting the plant-age hypothesis, because early herbivory is detrimental to growth. Faster-growing herbs may invest more in antiherbivore defense when they are older, supporting the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, because later herbivory limits their reproduction.  2012 Springer-Verlag.",196,2

However, a growing number of studies show that leaf herbivory can also induce defenses in plant reproductive tissues, which may deter mutualists such as pollinators and seed dispersers, or antagonists such as florivores and seed predators. Due to their direct interaction with plant reproductive tissues, deterrence of these mutualists or antagonists may have large negative or positive effects on plant fitness. Despite numerous predictions, we know little regarding the fitness consequences of leaf-toreproductive tissue induction in nature. Here, using observations of natural populations and manipulative field experiments, we show that leaf herbivory by the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) induces an accumulation of jasmonic acid and complex phenolics in reproductive tissues of the common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Consequently, seed predation by three native Lepidoptera is reduced by 77% on beetle-induced plants, while leaf herbivory itself has little impact on lifetime reproductive output. These results show that O. biennis benefits from being consumed by an invasive folivore, and that leaf-to-reproductive tissue induction can be an adaptive trait. Induced plant defenses can therefore be beneficial in a broader community context than previously realized.  2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",197,2

These factors may be affected by plant competition, which often interacts with damage to influence trait expression and fitness. However, few studies have manipulated competitor density to examine the evolutionary effects of competition on tolerance. In this study, we tested whether intraspecific competition affects four aspects of the evolution of tolerance to herbivory in the perennial plant Solanum carolinense: phenotypic expression, expression of genetic variation, the adaptive value of tolerance, and costs of tolerance. We manipulated insect damage and intraspecific competition for clonal lines of S. carolinense in a greenhouse experiment, and measured tolerance in terms of sexual and asexual fitness components. Compared to plants growing at low density, plants growing at high density had greater expression of and genetic variation in tolerance, and experienced greater fitness benefits from tolerance when damaged. Tolerance was not costly for plants growing at either density, and only plants growing at low density benefited from tolerance when undamaged, perhaps due to greater intrinsic growth rates of more tolerant genotypes. These results suggest that competition is likely to facilitate the evolution of tolerance in S. carolinense, and perhaps in other plants that regularly experience competition, while spatio-temporal variation in density may maintain genetic variation in tolerance.  2012 Springer-Verlag.",198,2

Climate change and urbanization pose multiple threats to these services. However, how these threats combine to affect urban trees, and thus how to mitigate their effects, remains largely untested because multi-factorial experiments on mature trees are impractical. We used a unique urban warming experiment paired with a laboratory chamber experiment to determine how three of the most potentially damaging factors associated with global change for urban and rural treeswarming, drought, and insect herbivoryaffect growth of Quercus phellos (willow oak), the most commonly planted large shade tree in the southeastern US, which is known for its resilience to these potential stressors. In a previous study, we found that the urban heat island effect was associated with reduced growth of Q.phellos and higher abundance of Parthenolecanium scale insects, key pests of oaks in cities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that tree water stress is the mechanism for these effects of warming. We found evidence that water stress is a major, interactive factor reducing urban tree growth, but found no evidence that water stress is associated with Parthenolecanium survival or abundance. Warming and Parthenolecanium only reduced growth in Q.phellos saplings that were simultaneously water stressed. Synthesis and applications. Across many temperate cities worldwide, urban trees grow less than rural trees. Our results point to water stress as the most likely driver for this pattern. Importantly, we found that water stress both reduces tree growth on its own and exacerbates effects of warming and insect pests on tree growth. Therefore, management strategies targeted at increasing tree hydration in cities may reduce effects of these three key stressors that are expected to intensify with further urbanization and climate change.  2018 The Authors.

Nurse plants, however, could affect other biotic interactions by reducing that natural benefit. Studies about plant-plant-animal interaction assume that plants can recover from and/or avoid granivory when they grow under higher resources availability; nevertheless, in early stages they could be subject to different pressures. Thus, the resistance or susceptibility to granivores could occur because of differential responses of the plants (nurse and protected) to the environment (abiotic factors). or as results of differential responses of the plants to granivores (biotic factors), altering the probability of the resistance or susceptibility of plants to herbivores. We evaluated diurnal and nocturnal granivore activity on P. leucocephalus seeds, and we also evaluated if a nurse species could determine the association type (i.e. associational resistance or susceptibility) from the intensity of the granivore in early stage (e.g. seeds) of the P. leucocephalus life cycle. We found higher granivory under nurse plants than in open spaces (the control group), indicating associational susceptibility.

This is important to plant growth, because a plant cannot always avoid damage, even if it has developed defence mechanisms against herbivores. In previous work, we elucidated the herbivory-induced compensatory response of Quercus (at both the individual shoot and whole sapling levels) in both low- and high-nutrient conditions throughout one growing season. In this study, we determine how the compensatory growth of Quercus serrata saplings is achieved at different nutrient levels.  Methods: Quercus serrata saplings were grown under controlled conditions. Length, number of leaves and percentage of leaf area lost on all extension units (EUs) were measured.  Key Results: Both the probability of flushing and the length of subsequent EUs significantly increased with an increase in the length of the parent EU. The probability of flushing increased with an increase in leaf damage of the parent EU, but the length of subsequent EUs decreased. This indicates that EU growth is fundamentally regulated at the individual EU level. The probabilities of a second and third flush were significantly higher in plants in high-nutrient soil than those in low-nutrient soil. The subsequent EUs of damaged saplings were also significantly longer at high-nutrient conditions.  Conclusions: An increase in the probability of flushes in response to herbivore damage is important for damaged saplings to produce new EUs; further, shortening the length of EUs helps to effectively reproduce foliage lost by herbivory. The probability of flushing also varied according to soil nutrient levels, suggesting that the compensatory growth of individual EUs in response to local damage levels is affected by the nutrients available to the whole sapling.

These include selection of effective control agents, host specificity of the biological control agents, implications of the genetic population structure of the target populations, and potential impact on native food webs. With regard to improving the success rate of biological control of plant invaders, we first emphasize the importance of a clear a priori definition of success and a more ecosystem-based approach to better document both negative effects of the invasive plant as well as potential positive and negative effects of introducing biological control agents. Secondly, pre-release impact assessment could be improved by better focusing on how to reach high densities of the control agents and by including tolerance to and compensation of herbivory. Thirdly, we advocate a reinforced effort to integrate and combine biological control in combination with existing or potential management options.

In grasslands, which broadly-defined cover 40% of the Earths terrestrial surface outside of Greenland and Antarctica, 40-60% of net primary productivity and 70-98% of invertebrate biomass occurs belowground, providing extensive scope for interactions between roots and rhizosphere invertebrates. Grasses invest 50-70% of fixed carbon into root construction, which suggests roots are high value tissues that should be defended from herbivores, but we know relatively little about such defenses. In this article, we identify candidate grass root defenses, including physical (tough) and chemical (toxic) resistance traits, together with indirect defenses involving recruitment of root herbivores natural enemies. We draw on relevant literature to establish whether these defenses are present in grasses, and specifically in grass roots, and which herbivores of grasses are affected by these defenses. Physical defenses could include structural macro-molecules such as lignin, cellulose, suberin, and callose in addition to silica and calcium oxalate. Root hairs and rhizosheaths, a structural adaptation unique to grasses, might also play defensive roles. To date, only lignin and silica have been shown to negatively affect root herbivores. In terms of chemical resistance traits, nitrate, oxalic acid, terpenoids, alkaloids, amino acids, cyanogenic glycosides, benzoxazinoids, phenolics, and proteinase inhibitors have the potential to negatively affect grass root herbivores. Several good examples demonstrate the existence of indirect defenses in grass roots, including maize, which can recruit entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) via emission of (E)--caryophyllene, and similar defenses are likely to be common. In producing this review, we aimed to equip researchers with candidate root defenses for further research.  2017 Moore and Johnson.",204,2

However, whether these inducible tolerance responses can be extended to pine trees and how these responses could be modulated by genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. Biomass allocation and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in above- and below-ground tissues were measured in Pinus pinaster juveniles belonging to 33 open-pollinated families grown under two P availabilities (P-deficient and complete fertilization). Measurements were taken 15days after half of the plants received a foliar spray treatment of 22mmolL -1 methyl jasmonate (MJ) to simulate above-ground herbivore attack. Simulated above-ground herbivory promoted a strong preferential allocation of biomass below ground in the form of fine roots, leading to an almost two-fold increase in fine root biomass in MJ-treated plants and a significant reduction in above-ground tissues and coarse roots. In addition, MJ signalling increased P and N concentrations in the shoots while reducing (P) or maintaining (N) concentrations in the roots. These results suggest that induced resource sequestration is not a generalized strategy in this pine species. Fine root biomass and concentration of N and P in plant tissues showed additive genetic variation, but responses to MJ signalling did not vary among families. Allocation of biomass to fine roots was not affected by P availability, whereas allocation of P to the shoot was more intense under complete fertilization. Synthesis: Two new putative tolerance mechanisms inducible by MJ signalling may help to minimize the impact of above-ground herbivore damage on the future fitness of young pine trees by (i) allocation of carbon to fine roots, this appeared to be a generalized strategy with weak environmental modulation and (ii) reallocation of P and N from roots to shoots, which was largely affected by P availability, and thus susceptible to greater phenotypic variation in heterogeneous environments. We provide evidence that changes in tolerance-related traits are rapidly inducible by herbivory cues in this pine species. These results should be integrated with induced resistance responses to fully understand the costs and benefits associated with induced responses to herbivory.  2011 The Authors.

Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant-enemy and plant-mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of (negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists.

The growth response of two decreasers, three Increaser II grasses, and an Increaser III species to frequent, severe defoliation under three levels of competition from neighbours and two levels of soil nutrients was examined in a pot trial. The effects of competition and especially nutrients markedly modified the defoliation tolerance of different species, and grazing response groups varied in the manner in which their defoliation responses were mediated by these interactions. Contrary to expectation, defoliation constrained potential productivity most in nutrient-rich, competition-free environments, probably because it exacerbates a carbon limitation on growth. However, nutrient enrichment did enable Increaser II grasses, but not other species, to better tolerate intense defoliation, explaining why they can persist on intensively grazed fertile patches and in heavily stocked grassland, such as in communal areas, where nutrients are more available. It is concluded that grazing tolerance is not a fixed property of species or grazing response groups but depends on biotic and abiotic environmental factors.",207,2

Furthermore, species may respond differently to drought when other influences, such as herbivory, are considered. To explore this relationship, we conducted a greenhouse experiment measuring responses to inter- and intraspecific competition for two grasses, Schedonorus arundinaceus and Paspalum dilatatum, while varying water availability and simulating herbivory via clipping. We then parameterized population growth models to examine the long-term outcome of competition under these conditions. Under drought, S. arundinaceus was less water stressed than P. dilatatum, which exhibited severe water stress; clipping alleviated this stress, increasing the competitive ability of P. dilatatum relative to S. arundinaceus. Although P. dilatatum competed weakly under drought, clipping reduced water stress in P. dilatatum, thereby enhancing its ability to compete with S. arundinaceus under drought. Supporting these observations, population growth models predicted that P. dilatatum would exclude S. arundinaceus when clipped under drought, while S. arundinaceus would exclude P. dilatatum when unclipped under drought. When the modeled environment varied temporally, environmental variation promoted niche differences that, though insufficient to maintain stable coexistence, prevented unconditional competitive exclusion by promoting priority effects. Our results suggest that it is important to consider how species respond not just to stable, but also to variable, environments. When species differ in their responses to drought, competition, and simulated herbivory, stable environments may promote competitive exclusion, while fluctuating environments may promote coexistence. These interactions are critical to understanding how species will respond to global change.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",208,2

Recent theory suggests that compensation or even overcompensation in stage-specific biomass can arise in response to increased mortality. Which stage that will show compensation depends on whether maturation or reproduction is the more limiting process in the population. Size-structured theory also provides a strong link between the type of regulation and the expected population dynamics as both depend on size / stage-specific competitive ability. 2. We imposed a size-independent mortality on a consumer-resource system with Daphnia pulex feeding on Scenedesmus obtusiusculus to asses the compensatory responses in Daphnia populations. We also extended an existing stage-structured biomass model by including several juvenile stages to test whether this extension affected the qualitative results of the existing model. 3. We found complete compensation in juvenile biomass and total population fecundity in response to harvesting. The compensation in fecundity was caused by both a higher proportion of fecund females and a larger clutch size under increased mortality. We did not detect any difference in resource levels between treatments. 4. The model results showed that both stages of juveniles have to be superior to adults in terms of resource competition for the compensatory response to take place in juvenile biomass. 5. The results are all in correspondence with that the regulating process within the population was reproduction. From this, we also conclude that juveniles were superior competitors to adults, which has implications for population dynamics and the kind of cohort cycles seen in Daphnia populations. 6.

This speciesfeeds only on expanding leaf and stem tissues of seedlings and saplings of the prizedtimber tree, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). We synthesize publishedresearch, observational reports, and anecdotal evidence about S. poliophaea's life history,ecology, and impact on host mahogany populations across southern Brazilian Amazonia.This moth plays an important role in suppressing the early recruitment and growth, andhence potential local dominance, of the fast-growing S. macrophylla.

We compare the ecologicalsignificance of S. poliophaea to the better known shoot-boring moth, Hypsipylagrandella (Pyralidae) that is a major pest in mahogany plantations throughout theNeotropics.

Perhaps a better understanding of how this interaction might limit sapling recruitment in tree populations may be achieved by examining species' functional responses to herbivores on a continuum of resource availability. Here, we experimentally reduced herbivore pressure on newly established seedlings of two dominant masting trees in 40 canopy gaps, across c. 80 ha of tropical rain forest in central Africa (Korup, Cameroon). Mesh cages were built to protect individual seedlings, and their leaf production and changes in height were followed for 22 months. With more light, herbivores increasingly prevented the less shade-tolerant Microberlinia bisulcata from growing as tall as it could and producing more leaves, indicating an undercompensation. The more shade-tolerant Tetraberlinia bifoliolata was much less affected by herbivores, showing instead near to full compensation for leaf numbers, and a negligible to weak impact of herbivores on its height growth. A stage-matrix model that compared control and caged populations lent evidence for a stronger impact of herbivores on the long-term population dynamics of M. bisulcata than T. bifoliolata. Our results suggest that insect herbivores can contribute to the local coexistence of two abundant tree species at Korup by disproportionately suppressing sapling recruitment of the faster-growing dominant via undercompensation across the light gradient created by canopy disturbances. The functional patterns we have documented here are consistent with current theory, and, because gap formations are integral to forest regeneration, they may be more widely applicable in other tropical forest communities. If so, the interaction between life-history and herbivore impact across light gradients may play a substantial role in tree species coexistence.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",211,2

Cumulative meta-analyses revealed dramatic temporal changes in the magnitude and direction of the plant and herbivore responses reported during the last two decades. Studies conducted in the 1980s reported increase in phenolic concentrations, reduction in nutrient concentrations and negative effect on herbivore performance, consistently with the idea of induced resistance. In contrast, in the early 1990s when the idea that some types of plant damage may result in induced susceptibility was generally accepted, studies reported non-significant results or induced susceptibility, and smaller effects on herbivores. The above changes may reflect paradigm shifts in the theory of induced defenses and/or the differences between study systems used in the early and the more recent studies. Overall, plant growth and carbohydrate concentrations were reduced in damaged plants despite enhanced photosynthetic rates. Damage increased the concentrations of carbon and phenolics, while terpene concentrations tended to decrease after damage; changes in nutrient concentrations after damage varied according to nutrient mobility, inherent plant growth rate, ontogenetic stage and plant type (deciduous/evergreen). Early season damage caused more pronounced changes in plants than late season damage, which is in accordance with the assumption that vigorously growing foliage has a greater capacity to respond to damage. Insect growth rate and female pupal weight decreased on previously damaged plants, while herbivore survival, consumption and male pupal weight were not significantly affected.

Iteroparous perennials can be used to test whether enhanced reproduction in 1 year has negative future consequences as predicted by optimal allocation models. This study was intended to verify this prediction in the iteroparous herb Sedum maximum, applying mechanically simulated herbivory. I monitored 132 labelled S. maximum individuals during 2 years of study. They were randomly assigned to two groups: clipped and control. Infructescence dry mass, total seed dry mass, seed size, germination rate and an increase of root dry mass during the season were assessed in the experimental plants. Since only roots can survive to the next season, root dry mass was considered a reliable measure of allocation to future performance. Clipped plants showed increased fruit and seed dry mass versus the controls, with no other aspect of reproduction affected. Apical bud removal also had a positive effect on increase of root dry mass. The results indicate true overcompensation in response to simulated herbivory with no future costs of increased reproduction. Moreover, increased plant reproduction as a result of herbivory is likely to persist in the following years: clipping increased not only seed production but also root growth. This response is inconsistent with the results of optimal allocation models and the discrepancy is probably due to violation of the resource limitation assumption. Plants adapted to tolerate herbivory seem not to reproduce at the maximum rate when undamaged, but rather withhold resources to be allocated to reproduction after herbivory.  2011 The Author(s).",213,2

Although knowledge of the effect of herbivores on specific plants and communities is quite extensive, little is known about the relative impact of large and small vertebrate herbivores and how it might vary among different habitats. To address this key issue, we established exclosures with two different mesh sizes in forest and nearby tundra at three different sites in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. Plant community composition was recorded annually in three permanent plots within each exclosure and an unfenced control. Local densities of vertebrate herbivores were estimated in spring and autumn from 1998 to 2002. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) were the most abundant large vertebrate while Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus) were the most common small vertebrates. The study reveals that voles and lemmings have larger effects on the vegetation than reindeer in both habitats in all four locations, even though densities of reindeer differ between locations and only two locations experienced lemming peaks during the period of the experiment. The relative abundance of five of the fifteen most common species was significantly influenced by voles and lemmings whereas only a single species was significantly influenced by reindeer. Different analyses give contrasting results on the importance of herbivory in forest versus open heathlands. A principal component analyses revealed that herbivory influenced the vegetation more in open heathlands than in forests. However, an importance index of herbivores did not differ between forest and open heathlands. Moreover, none of the plant species responded differently in the two habitats, when herbivores were removed.

Although the evidence of greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus, tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall, phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients, light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile task because different traits favor invasiveness in different environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global macro-analyses.",215,2

Using the Lhasa River region of the Tibetan Plateau, we examined temporal and spatial variations in the components of NPP over a 10-year period. Results showed that NPPpot, HANPP and NPPeco increased from 2000 to 2010, but at different rates and with different spatial patterns. NPPgap each year ranged from -9.2% to 13.1% for each site and on average composed 1.2% of the total NPPpot. NPPgap was significantly correlated with precipitation, plant biodiversity, plant height and soil properties. NPPgap increased if either of the previous 2 years had been wet years with relative high precipitation. An increase in the richness of palatable species would lead to a larger NPPgap through more compensatory growth. The large fluctuation level of NPPgap reflected the higher stability of vegetation productivity, which is caused by higher plant heights and soil maximum water capacity.

Herbivory is an important biotic stressor and may limit plant functional responses to challenging environmental conditions such as shading. In this study we investigated whether plant functional responses and PP to shade are constrained by herbivory, and whether such constraints are due to direct effects based on resource limitation by considering ontogeny. We used as a model system the relict tree Prunus lusitanica and implemented an indoor experiment to quantify the response of saplings of different ages to shade and herbivory. We measured five functional traits and quantitatively calculated PP. Results showed that herbivory did not constrain functional responses or PP to shade except for shoot:root ratio (SR), which, despite showing a high PP in damaged saplings, decreased under shade instead of increasing. Damaged saplings of older age did not exhibit reduced constraints on functional responses to shade and generally presented a lower PP than damaged saplings of younger age. Our findings suggest that herbivory-mediated constraints on plant plasticity to shade may not be as widespread as previously thought. Nonetheless, the negative effect of herbivory on SR plastic expression to shade could be detrimental for plant fitness. Finally, our results suggest a secondary role of direct effects (resource-based) on P.lusitanica plasticity limitation.

Tolerance has long been hypothesized to be constrained evolutionarily by plant resistance to herbivores, traits that allow plants to cope with stressful growing conditions, and traits that influence the timing of damage in relation to reproduction. Variation in tolerance and resistance can be caused by differences in the identity of the plant (e.g., genotype, species, clade) and by the context of the herbivore threat (e.g., identity of the herbivore, type of damage it causes, abiotic conditions in which the plant is growing). To date, the vast majority of studies have explored trade-offs with tolerance within species. Here, we test hypotheses of constraints on tolerance using comparative approaches in a clade of mustards, emphasizing the variety of contexts in which damage is realistically tolerated. We estimated tolerance to leaf damage, tolerance to apical clipping at the bolting stage  simulating browsing , and resistance to a specialist and generalist lepidopteran herbivore for a group of native mustards, grown in field soils unique to each population and in a common potting soil. Resistance to herbivores was soil dependent, while surprisingly, tolerance was not. Phylogenetic signal in resistance to specialist and generalist lepidopteran herbivores was present, but only when plants were grown in field soils. Tolerance had low phylogenetic signal. Tolerance to leaf damage was unrelated to tolerance to simulated browse. We found no evidence for a resistance-tolerance trade-off, and some evidence for a soil-dependent positive correlation between tolerance and resistance to both herbivores. Drought-tolerant species had poorer ability to tolerate browse damage, and earlier flowering species tended to be less tolerant to leaf damage. Our results suggest that tolerance trades off with traits that allow mostly annual, monocarpic Streptanthus (s.l.) to persist in drought-prone conditions but is largely unrelated to resistance to herbivores.

Recent evidence suggests that these trait differences between groups can be context dependent, varying with environmental factors such as resource availability and disturbance. However, many previous comparisons among plant groups differing in invasion status have not standardized growth form between groups or have compared species that do not co-occur, which could result in invasion status per se being confounded with other factors. We determined growth and leaf functional trait responses of 20 co-occurring woody species, that is, five species within each of four functional groups (native N-fixers, native non-N-fixers, nonnative [invasive] N-fixers and nonnative [invasive] non-N-fixers), to factorial combinations of soil fertility and defoliation treatments in a mesocosm experiment to test each of two hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that nonnative invasive and N-fixing species will have functional traits associated with rapid resource acquisition whereas natives and non-N-fixing species will have traits linked to resource conservation. Second, we hypothesized that plant growth and leaf traits of nonnative and N-fixing species will be more strongly influenced by environmental factors (i.e., soil fertility and disturbance) than will natives and non-N-fixers. Plant growth, foliar nutrients, and leaf structural traits varied among plant functional groups in a manner consistent with our first hypothesis. Support for our second hypothesis was mixed; origin (native vs. nonnative) and soil fertility rarely interacted to determine plant growth or variation in leaf traits whereas interactions involving N-fixing ability and soil fertility were common. Further, there were no consistent interactive effects between plant groupings and disturbance. Our results demonstrate that variation in growth and functional traits among plant species were driven primarily by the relatively large responses of nonnative N-fixers to soil fertility, rather than by consistent differences between other plant functional groups. These findings highlight the importance of resource availability in determining trait or performance differences among plant functional groups, and provide insights into the assembly of plant functional traits in novel communities of co-occurring native and nonnative species.  2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",220,2

Tolerance to biomass loss, and the ability to regrow new photosynthetic tissue after herbivore attack, is one such important mechanism. Here we experimentally studied how year-round browsing corresponding to four different levels of moose, Alces alces, population density affected total annual browse biomass production, which also serves as a proxy for production of new photosynthetic tissue, in birch (Betula pubescens and B. pendula) and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, along a habitat productivity gradient. Our results revealed that habitat productivity index was the most important variable determining annual browse biomass production for birch, and that a high moose density and biomass removals of 25-40% annually actually could stimulate birch above-ground productivity in more productive sites. Contrary to birch, pine was not affected by habitat productivity index, and appeared to have much lower regrowth capacity than birch. For pine, percent biomass removed was the most important factor affecting annual browse biomass production, which decreased with increasing levels of biomass removal. We also tested if birch and pine responded to biomass removal by allocating more resources to browse biomass production at in the lower portion of the stem (0-0.5 m), which was protected from biomass removal in winter. Birch did not allocate more resources to biomass production in the lower portion of the stem, whereas pines subjected to high biomass removal had more biomass in the lower portion of the stem than those protected from losses. Our study thus shows that plant responses can be linear or non-linear along the range of herbivore densities we studied, and that responses can change from negative to positive along underlying habitat productivity gradients.

This study examined the impacts of plant genotype, endophyte infection, and plant ontogeny on host plant and insect responses during whole-plant feeding by T. paludosa. A series of no-choice greenhouse trials were conducted with third instar crane flies to determine 1) host plant tolerance in terms of reductions to above- and belowground plant biomass, 2) antixenosis resistance impacting insect behavior (emigration), and 3) antibiosis resistance impacting insect growth. Results showed that insect infestation level was the primary factor influencing plant biomass reductions. Belowground tissues were more tolerant to feeding than were aboveground tissues, with tall fescues, Festuca arundinacea Schreber, being most resistant to aboveground biomass reduction.

However, in favorable conditions, effects of herbivory on plants may be neutral or even beneficial. According to the compensatory continuum hypothesis plants can tolerate herbivory best in resource-rich conditions. Besides herbivory, also primarily positive biotic interactions like mycorrhizal symbiosis, bear carbon costs. Tritrophic plant-fungus-herbivore interaction further complicates plant's cost-benefit balance, because herbivory of the host plant is expected to cause decline in mycorrhizal colonization under high availability of soil nutrients when benefits of symbiosis decline in relation to costs. To gain insight into above interactions we tested the effects of plant size and resource manipulation (simulated herbivory and fertilization) on both above-ground performance and on root fungal colonization of the biennial Gentianella campestris.Clipping caused allocation shift from height growth to branches in all groups except in large and fertilized plants. For large plants nutrient addition may have come too late, as the number of meristems was most likely determined already before the fertilization. Clipping decreased the amount of DSE (dark septate endophytic) fungi which generally are not considered to be mycorrhizal. The effect of clipping on total fungal colonization and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal coils were found to depend on host size and resource level. Dissimilar mycorrhizal response to simulated herbivory in small vs. large plants could be due to more intensive light competition in case of small plants. Carbon limited small plants may not be able to maintain high mycorrhizal colonization, whereas large clipped plants allocate extra resources to roots and mycorrhizal fungi at the expense of above-ground parts. Our results suggest that herbivory may increase carbon limitation that leads re-growing shoots and fungal symbionts to function as competing sinks for the limited carbon reserves.  2011 Elsevier GmbH.",225,2

However, very few studies have investigated the potential damage of large herbivores on plant diversity in Mediterranean protected areas. In this study, we describe the population structure and the long-term dynamics of the main populations of the Sardinian narrow endemic Centaurea horrida Bad. (Asteraceae), by means of permanent plots where individual plants were tagged and monitored through 6 years (2004-2009). We monitored this endangered plant at three sites: two were protected areas where introduced and feral ungulates are present, and the other one was a non-protected site without introduced ungulates. We found that adults and saplings were more abundant at the non-protected site. Through matrix models, we also highlighted that the non-protected population showed the highest population growth rate. Finally, by means of an exclusion experiment for ungulates at one protected site, we demonstrated that herbivores had a negative effect on the survival of seedlings and adult plants, and reduced the stochastic population growth rate. An LTRE analysis showed that differences in the survival, especially of adult individuals, had the highest responsibility in explaining the higher population growth rate when herbivores are excluded. Our study constitutes a clear example on how the protection of alien large herbivores can have opposite effects on the conservation of an endangered plant. Some management options are proposed, and the urgent need of manipulative experiments on species-specific interactions between protected plants and alien herbivore species is invoked.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",226,2

We address these challenges through research in plant-herbivore interactions, specifically overcompensatory responses in potato to herbivore damage. While herbivory is usually detrimental to most crops, some potato cultivars can overcompensate and increase crop productivity up to two-fold in response to herbivore damage. However, biotic and abiotic factors are known to influence compensatory responses. Here we tested if compensatory plant responses to herbivory increase productivity of potatoes under field conditions along gradients of altitude and landscape simplification in 15 different farms. Our results suggest that compensatory plant responses could double the mean productivity of a potato farm in relation to the productivity of undamaged plants. The compensatory response is best predicted by pest pressure on a farm with potato plants having the maximum productivity when 10% of the tubers are damaged and decreasing in productivity as pest pressure increases. To a lesser extent an interaction between altitude and landscape simplification did affect the compensatory response, suggesting that abiotic factors play an important role in compensation. Our results suggest that overcompensation-based management practices could be used to maximize yields on working potato farms. Further research is required to determine action thresholds (i.e. the damage levels at which pest control needs to be enacted to maximize yields and minimize insecticide use) to develop more sustainable ways of increasing yields in the future.  2017 by the Ecological Society of America",227,2

White-tailed deer are significant herbivores in North America that have been broadly documented to affect plant reproductive success. If variation in the frequency and impact of herbivory by deer correlates with a broad-scale latitudinal gradient, climactic effects may be important for shaping plant-herbivore interactions. Alternatively, a lack of broadscale gradients would suggest local factors such as plant community composition and deer densities are affecting herbivory. To investigate broad-scale patterns of deer herbivory, we examined the frequency and reproductive consequences of deer browse over three years in 17 populations of Campanulastrum americanum spanning the latitudinal extent of its range. Even though deer are overabundant throughout the range of C. americanum, we found spatiotemporal variation in deer browse frequency (0-0.96, mean 0.46) and its effects on plant reproductive success. The four southernmost populations experienced high levels of herbivory, and were responsible for generating a negative relationship between latitude and herbivory. In general, patterns of variation in the frequency and impact of herbivory across the entire latitudinal gradient pointed to the importance of local rather than broad-scale factors. Within a population, deer consumed larger plants. Across many populations and years, average fitnesses of browsed and uneaten plants were similar, suggesting that plants are tolerant to browse. However, since large plants have greater reproductive success and are more likely to be browsed, tolerance may be influenced by plant size. When plant size was accounted for, most populations did not fully compensate for browsing. There was no relationship between browsing intensity and tolerance, suggesting that browsing may be too variable to consistently select for tolerance, or that increases in deer density are too recent for increased tolerance to evolve.  2015 by the Ecological Society of America.",228,2

Tolerance to herbivory is of particular interest because of the potential for using biological agents to control the spread of invasive plants. In this study, we compared herbivory tolerance in six populations of tall form Spartina alterniflora: three from its introduced range in Jiangsu Province, China, and three from its native range in Georgia, USA. Plants were grown in a greenhouse and subjected to a full-factorial experimental design with three simulated leaf herbivory levels and two levels of nitrogen availability for 20. weeks. We found that native and invasive tall form S. alterniflora grown under different nitrogen conditions responded to simulated leaf herbivory differently with regard to underground and aboveground biomass and total culm height. Invasive S. alterniflora populations had a greater capacity to compensate for leaf damage than native populations in terms of underground biomass and aboveground biomass, particularly with low nitrogen availability. In addition, invasive S. alterniflora also showed higher compensatory capacity than native plants with regard to total culm height in both nitrogen treatments and with regard to tiller number in the high nitrogen treatment. Elevated nitrogen availability significantly increased the compensatory capacity of underground biomass in native S. alterniflora populations but did not affect any factor in invasive populations. Our results suggested a rapid evolutionary change in herbivory tolerance of invasive tall form S. alterniflora after its introduction to China. Understanding such changes in the tolerance to herbivory between native and invasive populations of alien plants has important implications for improving management efficiency.  2012 Elsevier B.V.",229,2

While plant compensatory responses to herbivory include reallocation of biomass from below-ground to above-ground structures, plant responses to reduced soil moisture involve increased biomass allocation to roots and a reduction in the number and size of leaves. In a greenhouse study we evaluated the effects of experimental drought and leaf damage on biomass allocation in Convolvulus demissus (Convolvulaceae), a perennial herb distributed in central Chile, where it experiences summer drought typical of Mediterranean ecosystems and defoliation by leaf beetles and livestock. The number of leaves and internode length were unaffected by the experimental treatments. The rest of plant traits showed interaction of effects. We detected that drought counteracted some plant responses to damage. Thus, only in the control watering environment was it observed that damaged plants produced more stems, even after correcting for main stem length (index of architecture). In the cases of shoot: root ratio, relative shoot biomass and relative root biomass we found that the damage treatment counteracted plant responses to drought. Thus, while undamaged plants under water shortage showed a significant increase in root relative biomass and a significant reduction in both shoot: root ratio and relative shoot biomass, none of these responses to drought was observed in damaged plants. Total plant biomass increased in response to simulated herbivory, apparently due to greater shoot size, and in response to drought, presumably due to greater root size. However, damaged plants under experimental drought had the same total biomass as control plants. Overall, our results showed counteractive biomass allocation responses to drought and damage in C. demissus. Further research must address the fitness consequences under field conditions of the patterns found. This would be of particular importance because both current and expected climatic trends for central Chile indicate increased aridity.  2009 The Authors.

Plant neighbors can exert strong facilitative as well as competitive effects, however, and facilitation is often mediated through the reduction of environmental stresses. Thus, neighbors may simultaneously increase plant compensation for herbivory, by reducing environmental stress, and reduce compensation by competing for resources. To determine whether aboveground competition and facilitation influence the ability of an annual forb, Atriplex patula var. hastata, to compensate for herbivory, I performed a field experiment in which the presence of insect herbivores and plant neighbors were manipulated in a factorial design. The neighbor treatments included removal of dominant rushes (cleared), rushes left intact (vegetated), and rush removal plus reduction of environmental stress by shading of the soil surface (buffered). In cleared treatments, herbivory reduced survival by almost 50% and reproduction by 37%. In contrast herbivory had no significant effects on plant survival or reproductive output in buffered treatments. Thus, facilitation through soil shading increased plant compensation for herbivory. However, herbivores also strongly reduced fruit production (45%) in vegetated treatments, suggesting that competition magnifies herbivore impacts. The results demonstrate that neighboring plants can simultaneously increase and decrease plant tolerance to herbivory.",231,2

The compensatory continuum hypothesis expects overcompensation to be more prevalent in resource rich environments compared to poor environments. This is paradoxical since in resource rich conditions the intact plants should branch most vigorously and hence any further increase in branch number should lead to lower seed yield. An explanation could be that apical dominance is rather insensitive to changes in resource availability, and that overcompensation is possible in conditions where plants experience meristem limitation (due to apical dominance) in relation to available resources. We explored the branching patterns and fitness responses of tall wormseed mustard (Erysimum strictum) to simulated browsing, soil nutrients, and competition in common garden. Competition increased apical dominance and reduced plant fitness whereas fertilization had the reverse effects. Simulated browsing increased lateral branching and had little impact on plant fitness. Fitness overcompensation was observed only among plants grown in competition and in the absence of fertilization - the most resource poor treatment combination in the experiment. The results contradict both with the compensation continuum and the assumption that apical dominance shows no or very little plasticity in relation to growing conditions. Because directional selection gradients on branch number were invariantly positive irrespective of growing conditions, we propose that, in spite of phenotypic plasticity of apical dominance, the plants appear to be meristem rather than resource limited, and that meristem limitation is strongest in conditions where intact plants produce fewest lateral branches. Our results deviate from the compensation continuum because resource availability affected compensation ability more strongly through phenotypic plasticity of shoot architecture rather than via changes in resource availability per se.

We used maternal full-sib lines of R. nudiflora and conducted a defoliation experiment in which half the plants of each line were subjected to removal of 40\% of leaf area (the other half remained undamaged). Fitness-correlated traits, physiological traits, and leaf longevity were measured during a 2-month period after defoliation. Using another set of plants, we conducted a second defoliation experiment and measured the concentration of non-structural carbohydrates to test for root-to-shoot carbon mobilization as a compensatory mechanism. R. nudiflora showed full compensation in terms of fruit output, and compensatory ability was positively correlated with investment in root biomass in the absence of damage. In addition, defoliated plants produced shorter-lived leaves and had a greater concentration of starch in roots, suggesting that reduced leaf longevity and accumulation of below-ground carbon reserves act as compensatory mechanisms.

However, scattered trees in agricultural landscapes are declining worldwide due to intensive land use. They are often perceived by farmers as having negative impacts on agricultural production. Large-scale assessments in different biomes of agricultural yield in scattered tree ecosystems remain rare. Filling this knowledge gap may help improve decision-making regarding the value of scattered trees in agricultural landscapes. Using meta-analysis, we found that, across four tree functional groups (deciduous, Eucalyptus, N-2-fixing, evergreen oak), mature scattered trees do not compromise pasture yield. The sign and magnitude of scattered tree effects on pasture yield did vary, however, among tree functional groups and according to precipitation levels. Our study suggests that, as drought pressure increases abiotic stress, tree facilitation by N-2-fixing trees, and competition by Eucalyptus, will become the more common interactions between scattered trees and pasture.

Infested tolerant maize plants produced more root biomass and even overcompensated for the lost roots, whereas this effect was absent in susceptible lines. Furthermore, the tolerant plants slowed growth of new roots in the greenhouse and in the field 4-8 days after infestation, whereas susceptible plants slowed growth of new roots only in the field and only after 12 days of infestation.

To test this hypothesis, we used artificial plant communities in microcosms With different levels of productivity (applying fertilizer) and herbivory (adding different numbers of the snail, Cepaea hortensis, and the grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus). For analyses, we assigned species to three functional groups: grasses, legumes and (non-leguminous) herbs.

Along the nutrient gradient, species composition shifted from a legume-dominated Community to a community dominated by fast-rowing annuals. But only legumes showed a consistent negative response to nutrients. while species of grasses and herbs showed idiosyncratic patterns. Herbivory had only minor effects. and bottom-up control was more important than top-down control. With increasing herbivory the biomass of the dominant plant species decreased and evenness increased. We found no interaction between nutrient availability and invertebrate herbivory. Again. species within functional groups showed no consistent responses to herbivory.

Furthermore, after prescribed fire, leaf-level stomatal conductance was unchanged for pines but decreased for oaks, while canopy stomatal conductance decreased temporarily, but then rebounded the following growing season, thus exhibiting transient responses.

The generalist herbivorous mite Tetranychus urticae induces defenses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and this constrains its fitness. By contrast, the Solanaceae-specialist Tetranychus evansi maintains a high reproductive performance by suppressing tomato defenses. Tetranychusevansi outcompetes T.urticae when infesting the same plant, but it is unknown whether this is facilitated by the defenses of the plant. We assessed the extent to which a secondary infestation by a competitor affects local plant defense responses (phytohormones and defense genes), mite gene expression and mite performance. We observed that T.evansi switches to hyper-suppression of defenses after its tomato host is also invaded by its natural competitor T.urticae. Jasmonate (JA) and salicylate (SA) defenses were suppressed more strongly, albeit only locally at the feeding site of T.evansi, upon introduction of T.urticae to the infested leaflet. The hyper-suppression of defenses coincided with increased expression of T.evansi genes coding for salivary defense-suppressing effector proteins and was paralleled by an increased reproductive performance. Together, these observations suggest that T.evansi overcompensates its reproduction through hyper-suppression of plant defenses in response to nearby competitors. We hypothesize that the competitor-induced overcompensation promotes competitive population growth of T.evansi on tomato.  2017 The Authors. New Phytologist  2017 New Phytologist Trust",242,2

Apical herbivory, which entails removal or damage to the apical meristem, causes a change in plant architecture by disrupting the balance of hormones produced in part by the apical meristem. Therefore, for an annual semelparous plant, the ability to preserve reproductive success following damage (i.e., to tolerate damage) is largely dependent on the plants pre-damage investment into fitness and its regrowth pattern following damage. Using multiple regression analyses, we assessed the relationship of developmental and architectural traits of experimentally damaged plants relative to undamaged plants of 33 Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes that display a wide range of undamaged fitness and damage tolerance. Our analyses revealed evidence for an evolutionary bet-hedging strategy within a subset of genotypes to presumably maximize fitness under natural herbivorygenotypes with the greatest seed production when undamaged exhibited a significant reduction in seed yield when damaged, while genotypes with low undamaged seed production were the only genotypes whose seed yield increased when damaged. Patterns of endopolyploidy paralleled those of seed production, such that the increase in whole-plant ploidy by genome re-replication during growth/regrowth contributes to undamaged fitness, damage tolerance, and their trade-off. Overall, this study provides the first large-scale characterization of A. thaliana regrowth patterns and suggests that investment into fitness and endopolyploidy when undamaged may come at a cost to tolerance ability once damaged.  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",243,2

However, very little is known about this relationship from complex ecosystems dominated by long-lived individuals, such as forests, especially over gradients of high plant diversity.2. We analysed insect herbivory on saplings of 10 tree and shrub species across 27 forest stands differing in age and tree species richness in an extraordinarily diverse subtropical forest ecosystem in China. We tested whether plant species richness significantly influences folivory in these highly diverse forests or whether other factors play a more important role at such high levels of phytodiversity.3. Leaf damage was assessed on 58 297 leaves of 1284 saplings at the end of the rainy season in 2008, together with structural and abiotic stand characteristics.4. Species-specific mean damage of leaf area ranged from 3% to 16%. Herbivory increased with plant species richness even after accounting for potentially confounding effects of stand characteristics, of which stand age-related aspects most clearly covaried with herbivory. Intraspecific density dependence or other abiotic factors did not significantly influence overall herbivory across forest stands.5. Synthesis. The positive herbivory-plant diversity relationship indicates that effects related to hypotheses of resource concentration, according to which a reduction in damage by specialized herbivores might be expected as host plant concentration decreases with increasing plant diversity, do not seem to be major determinants for overall herbivory levels in our phytodiverse subtropical forest ecosystem. We discuss the potential role of host specificity of dominant herbivores, which are often expected to show a high degree of specialization in many (sub)tropical forests. In the forest system we studied, a much higher impact of polyphagous species than traditionally assumed might explain the observed patterns, as these species can profit from a broad dietary mix provided by high plant diversity. Further testing is needed to experimentally verify this assumption.  2010 The Authors. Journal compilation  2010 British Ecological Society.",244,2

Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.",245,2

We tested for trade-offs in plant species responses to different types of consumers using a foodweb manipulation experiment in which we selectively excluded large vertebrate herbivores and removed foliar fungi, soil fungi, and insects from natural and experimentally planted grassland communities. We found no evidence for trade-offs in the ability of plants to defend themselves against different sets of consumers, although plants varied widely in their responses to removal of different consumer groups. In addition, the species-level responses to consumer removal in monoculture were uncorrelated with each species response in more diverse communities, highlighting the important role of local context (e.g., competition and apparent competition) in determining the effects of consumers. Plants must balance their allocation of energy among a wide variety of tasks including growing, competing for limited resources, and defending themselves against an array of potential enemies. We found that while plant species differed greatly in their response to the removal of consumers, species that were susceptible to the effects of one consumer group (e.g., insect herbivores) also were susceptible to other consumer groups (e.g., fungal pathogens). This suggests that plants differ in their overall allocation to defense, but defense investment can proffer protection against a wide array of natural enemies. We also found that plant responses to consumers depended on the diversity of the surrounding plant community, suggesting that among-plant interactions can alter their susceptibility to the impacts of consumers.  2018 by the Ecological Society of America",247,2

Several agents are expected to strengthen the control. The effects of insect type, density, and soil type on seedling survival and growth of the invasive tree Melaleuca quinquenervia were investigated in Florida. The biological control agents are Oxyops vitiosa (weevil) and Boreioglycaspis melaleucae (psyllid). A three-way factorial shade-house experiment was conducted, manipulating weevil density (zero/low/high), psyllid density (zero/low/high), and soil type (organic/sandy). Only high densities of one or both insects combined consistently reduced plant survival or growth; low densities did not. Overall, psyllids had stronger effects than weevils and for some performance parameters, the effects of one insect depended not only on its density but also on the density of the other insect. Interaction effects between insects were sometimes positive (i.e. seedling survival was lowest when both insects were in high densities). In other cases, high densities of only one agent were enough to reduce plant growth. Plants perform better on organic soils than on sandy soils. Weevils were more effective in reducing biomass on organic soils, while psyllids were more effective in reducing survival on sandy soils. Seedlings compensated for damage by producing more leaves, with the highest standing leaf crop at intermediate insect densities. These results show that the effectiveness of biological control on M. quinquenervia seedlings varies with insect species and depends upon insect density and soil type.  2010 Elsevier Inc.",248,2

Each stress reduced production of most plant structures, with drought stress having stronger impacts than clipping. The effects of the two stresses were additive for S. gigantea but synergistic for S. altissima, at least for aboveground biomass and inflorescence biomass.

The high nutrient, high light, warm year-round temperatures and lack of natural predators provide an optimal growth environment for the plant. The current study was designed to test if a compensatory response by the water hyacinth plants to low levels of biomass removal was one of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of biocontrol agents in the successful control of water hyacinth. The plants were exposed to two levels of nutrient (high and low) and three levels (0%, 10% and 80%) of simulated herbivory treatment. The effect of the nutrient and repeated (i.e., chronic) defoliation treatments was determined after 6 weeks. Plants with 10% defoliation did not show any significant difference from control plants in biomass allocation or relative growth rate (RGR) in either nutrient concentration, while 80% defoliation caused a significant decrease in the final RGR under high and low nutrient treatments. High nutrient treatment resulted in higher RGR and allocation to asexual reproduction resulting in higher biomass accumulation compared to the low nutrient treatment, which had higher root growth and allocation to sexual reproduction. Results from this study indicate that water hyacinth can fully compensate for low levels of continuous defoliation regardless of the nutrient concentration, which has implications and important considerations for biocontrol strategies.  2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we seek to separate specific community responses from general community responses of plant communities to exclusion of large cervid herbivores. Cervid herbivory and forestry are the main drivers of vegetation structure and diversity in boreal forests. While many studies focus on the impact of cervids on trees, a high proportion of the biodiversity and ecosystem services in boreal forests is found in the field layer. However, experimental approaches investigating the influence of herbivory on understory vegetation are highly localised. In this study we use a regional-scale design with 51 sites in four boreal forest regions of Norway, to investigate the influence of cervid herbivory on the physical and ecological structure of field layer vegetation. Our study sites cover a range of forest types differing in productivity, management and dominant cervid species, allowing us to identify generic responses and those that are specific to particular conditions. We found that the height of the field layer and the abundances of individual species were most susceptible to change following short-term cervid exclusion across different forest types and cervid species. Total vegetation density and vascular plant diversity did not respond to cervid exclusion on the same time scale. We also found that the field-layer vegetation in clear-cut forests used by moose was more susceptible to change following cervid exclusion than mature forests used by red deer, but no strong evidence that the response of vegetation to herbivore exclusion varied with productivity. Our study suggests that the parameters that respond to cervid exclusion are consistent across forest types, but that the responsiveness of different forest types is idiosyncratic and hard to predict.  2014 The Authors.

Attempts to restore native plant populations using managed grazing are common, despite the lack of an overarching quantitative basis for assessing livestock effects on different plant groups. Given the wide range of soils, climate and topography over which grasslands are found, it is important to understand the context-dependency of grazing effects across a region. We performed a meta-analysis of livestock grazing within California grasslands to investigate the response of different plant groups to grazing relative to precipitation, grassland type, soil and grazing regime. We found that exotic forbs showed a dramatic, uniform increase in cover with grazing, but no increase in richness. By contrast, native forbs increased in richness yet their cover response was weak and variable depending on grazing regime and precipitation. Exotic grass cover was unaffected while richness was enhanced by grazing. Native grass cover generally increased with grazing, although the high variation among studies was not predicted by the explanatory variables we evaluated. These results lend support to the use of grazing to enhance native forb richness and native grass cover in some settings although this must be weighed against increases in the cover of exotic forbs.  2012 Elsevier Ltd.",254,2

The distribution of features such as forage quality, water, or shade within a pasture can change the behavior of grazers and thus, the impact of their grazing. Where managed livestock grazing has been proposed as a conservation tool to enhance or maintain desirable plant communities, understanding how spatial variation between tree and intertree habitats within a savanna landscape affects the response of vegetation and soil properties to grazing will be critical for designing management plans for different sites. In this study, we used a previously established, long-term livestock grazing experiment in California oak {[}Quercus L.] savannas to investigate how the removal of grazing affected plant communities and soil characteristics underneath and outside of isolated tree canopies. In the oak understory, plant community composition shifted in response to livestock removal, largely due to a 68-400\% increase in the relative cover of native species. Overall plant community composition in open grassland neighboring trees changed little in response to livestock grazing removal, yet we did see a decrease in species richness and diversity surrounding deciduous oaks as the dominance of the exotic annual Bromus diandrus Roth increased. The depth of plant litter increased 1 2 cm in both habitat types when livestock grazing was absent, along with minor changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density. These results highlight how different habitat patches within savanna landscape can have varying responses to grazing removal and illustrate how challenging it will be to use grazing as a management tool to enhance the diversity of native species. In the oak understory, native species that are tolerant of herbivory may be absent or unable to coexist with non-native annual grasses. The abundance of understory habitat at a particular site may therefore be an important variable predicting the outcome of livestock grazing. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management.

These studies involved 92 plant species and 70 species of insect herbivore (including simulated herbivory). Attack to plant stems reduced plant performance by an average of approximately 22%.

Britton, Sterns & Poggenb., are frequently browsed by white-tailed deer and also experience both flooded and dry soils in natural habitats.Weconducted a growth chamber experiment to test for a potential interaction between simulated deer browsing and water availability treatments on seedling height, stem diameter, and above- and belowground biomass. Of the 180 study plants, half were subjected to an initial clipping treatment, and all plants were then exposed to high, intermediate, or low water availability for 90 days.Wefound that, over the short term, seedlings in favorable growing conditions could not compensate for lost biomass after simulated browsing. Drought reduced shoot biomass, and flooded soils reduced root but not shoot growth. Water stress and herbivory did not interact to reduce growth more than the effect of each treatment separately. In general, the effect of water stress on plant size was greater than the effect of simulated herbivory.  2017, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.",261,2

Leaf damage was recorded three times over the growing season (late spring, summer and early autumn). Five years after the initiation of the fragmentation, the density of rosettes did not differ between fragments and control plots. The number of leaves per rosette was higher in fragments than in control plots in summer but not in late spring and early autumn. The extent of leaf damage, expressed as proportion of leaf area removed by invertebrate herbivores, increased over the vegetation period. Leaf damage was greater in fragments than in control plots at two study sites, whereas the opposite (less strongly expressed) was found at the third site. Number of species and density (individuals per m2) of potential herbivores (gastropods and grasshoppers) were recorded in all fragments and control plots. Effects of fragmentation on the number of species and densities depended on plot size and differed between gastropods and grasshoppers. Leaf damage in fragments increased with increasing density of gastropods if the third site, which had lowest leaf damage, was excluded. Such a positive relationship was neither found in control plots nor for grasshopper densities. Thus, movement of gastropods in fragments was probably restricted which resulted in increased feeding pressure at least in two sites.

The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey, extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of the challenge of future research.",265,2

Here, it was tested whether defenses provided by Neotyphodium coenophialum in Lolium arundinaceum (tall fescue) are inducible by both mechanical damage and herbivory from an invertebrate herbivore, Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), via a bioassay and by quantifying mRNA expression for lolC, a gene required for loline biosysnthesis.  Both mechanical and herbivore damage had a negative effect on the reproduction of a subsequent herbivore, Rhopalosiphum padi (bird cherry-oat aphid), and herbivore damage caused an up-regulation of lolC. Uninfected grass hosts also had significantly higher foliar N% and lower C : N ratio compared with infected hosts, suggesting greater allocation to growth rather than defense.

Understanding plant tolerance to herbivory under different environmental conditions will help to improve biocontrol efficacy. The invasive alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) has been successfully controlled by natural enemies in many aquatic habitats but not in terrestrial environments worldwide. This study examined the effects of different levels of simulated leaf herbivory on the growth of alligator weed at two levels of fertilization and three levels of soil moisture (aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats). Increasing levels of simulated (manual) defoliation generally caused decreases in total biomass in all habitats. However, the plant appeared to respond differently to high levels of herbivory in the three habitats. Terrestrial plants showed the highest below-above ground mass ratio (R/S), indicating the plant is more tolerant to herbivory in terrestrial habitats than in aquatic habitats. The unfertilized treatment exhibited greater tolerance than the fertilized treatment in the terrestrial habitat at the first stage of this experiment (day 15), but fertilizer appears not to have influenced tolerance at the middle and last stages of the experiment. No such difference was found in semi-aquatic and aquatic habitats. These findings suggest that plant tolerance is affected by habitats and soil nutrients and this relationship could influence the biological control outcome.

However, little information is available for the performance of invasive plants subject to insect herbivory and limited resources availability. We conducted a glasshouse experiment using both the invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener Alternanthera sessilis, to compare the effects of resource availability on plant tolerance to herbivory. The results suggest that water availability affects plant tolerance to herbivory, such that stressful water conditions promoted greater herbivore tolerance for A. philoxeroides and decreased herbivore tolerance for A. sessilis. The addition of fertiliser also affected the plant's ability to respond to herbivory. Fertilised plants of both species generated more biomass and had greater tolerance to herbivory than unfertilised plants. Adding fertiliser appeared to increase the compensation capacity to herbivory for A. philoxeroides. In unfertilised conditions, moisture had no effect on A. philoxeroides tolerance to herbivory, and plants performed better under drought conditions. The results of this study may help to further our understanding of why biological control efforts against A.philoxeroides have been successful in some aquatic environments, but not others. Our study suggests that control of A.philoxeroides in high-moisture and nutrient poor environments should be more effective than control under nutrient rich and low-moisture soils. Understanding the mechanism of invasive plant compensation under different environmental conditions will be important for improving and predicting management efficiency.  2010 The Authors.

One proximate cause of this variation is resource availability, which can influence tolerance through mechanisms such as growth rate and photosynthesis. We examined the effect of high and low soil nutrient levels on the relationship between tolerance and two of its underlying mechanisms, biomass regrowth and photosynthetic upregulation, among genotypes of the Mediterranean annual grass Avena barbata. Although defoliated plants did not reach the same biomass as controls, biomass regrowth was higher at high nutrients. However, increased seed abortion at high nutrients caused tolerance to be the same in both nutrient treatments. Increased seed abortion also uncoupled biomass regrowth from tolerance at high nutrients. We found no evidence for photosynthetic upregulation in defoliated compared to control plants in either nutrient treatment. However, tolerance was positively correlated with predefoliation photosynthetic efficiency at high nutrients. Thus, constitutive photosynthetic efficiency may be a better predictor of tolerance than photosynthetic responses following herbivory in A. barbata. More generally, our results highlight the possibility that the mechanisms of tolerance can differ across resource environments even if tolerance is the same.",269,2

We calculate the difference in carbon stocks resulting from herbivore exclusion using the results of 108 studies from 52 vegetation types. Our estimates suggest that herbivores can reduce terrestrial above- and below-ground carbon stocks across vegetation types but reductions in carbon stocks may approach zero given sufficient periods of time for systems to respond to herbivory (i.e. decades). We estimate that if all large herbivores were removed from the vegetation types sampled in our review, increases in terrestrial carbon stocks would be up to three orders of magnitude less than many of the natural and human-influenced sources of carbon emissions. However, we lack estimates for the effects of herbivores on below-ground biomass and soil carbon levels in many regions, including those with high herbivore densities, and upwards revisions of our estimates may be necessary.

Tolerance to herbivory and chemical defence represent two distinct defence strategies of plants, and there is accumulating evidence that AMF can influence each strategy separately. However, investigations on the simultaneous effects of AMF on tolerance and chemical defence mechanisms are lacking. Using six milkweed (Asclepias) species and three levels of AMF inoculum, we show that plant tolerance to herbivory increases with foliar P concentrations, while both foliar cardenolide concentration and latex exudation (major chemical defences in milkweeds) increase with foliar N concentrations, but decrease with plant growth rate. Additionally, foliar cardenolide concentration increases with foliar P concentration, and latex exudation increases with root biomass. Because AMF have significant effects on all of these traits (foliar N and P concentrations, root biomass and growth rate), AMF can change plant tolerance and chemical defence simultaneously, albeit through different mechanisms. Synthesis. Overall, plant tolerance and chemical defence to herbivores are affected by AMF through changes in basic plant physiology such as nutrient status, allocation patterns and growth rate, and our study suggests that it may be possible to predict effects of AMF on plant defences through these simple traits.

In this study, we quantify yield benefits of mealybug biological control in Thailands cassava crop by using two different types of manipulative field trials: i.e., physical exclusion cage trials and field-level chemical exclusion assays. In cage trials with two popular cassava varieties, root yield and total dry matter (or biological yield) were a respective 4.04.2 times and 3.53.9 times higher in the presence of biological control. Extrapolating results from cage trials, biological control thus ensured an approximate yield gain of 5.310.0 T/ha for either variety. Under chemical exclusion trials, P. manihoti populations attained levels of 3266  1021 cumulative mealybug-days (CMD) over a 10-month time period, and no longer impact yields.

In plants with long-term belowground storage, allocation of biomass to inaccessible parts belowground in response to folivory is a well-recognized tolerance mechanism. In temperate regions, spring growth from buried rootstock is common among winter deciduous plants and is often followed by regrowth after defoliation, both of which draws resources from the stored reserves. We developed a mathematical model to analyze this tolerance response in a winter deciduous plant with long-term belowground biomass when it is defoliated by a specialist insect folivore. The model explores how three closely associated traits(1) belowground biomass allocation to roots, (2) spring utilization of stored reserves, and (3) post-defoliation regrowth capacitymodulate the persistence and dynamics of the plant and herbivore populations. Model results show that allocation to belowground storage is not only a critical component of tolerance but also influences the herbivore population dynamics in ways that depend on how and when plant biomass is allocated and used. Low belowground biomass allocation and high storage utilization combined with poor photosynthetic growth caused extirpation of the plant population by the defoliating insects. Stable coexistence of the plant at low biomass along with its specialist insect required a moderate amount of post-herbivory belowground allocation. High values of belowground biomass allocation, storage utilization, and photosynthetic growth resulted in sustained cycles of the herbivore and plant populations. Interestingly, utilization of stored reserves had conflicting influence on above and belowground biomass, and strongly affected herbivore population dynamics. Our model thus highlights the complexity of tolerance response when it involves multiple traits and mechanisms as evinced by winter deciduous plants. We close by discussing the implications of our findings for the contributions of defoliating insects to biocontrol programs.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",274,2

For example, both plants and sessile filter-feeders had positive effects on richness and diversity of mobile consumers. The contrasting negative and positive effects on similar versus higher trophic levels are potentially manifested through community-wide antagonism (competition and consumption) versus facilitation (habitat and food provisioning) interactions, respectively.

I tested the hypotheses that a) simulated N deposition alone would positively affect plant performance, b) herbivory alone would detrimentally affect plant performance and c) when combined, the positive impacts of N deposition would be mitigated by N-induced increases in herbivore consumption rates and population sizes. I assessed the response of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asteraceae, common ragweed) to simulated N deposition and herbivory by aphids and beetles. In greenhouse and field studies, I caged multivoltine herbivores on plants and allowed damage rates to differ among N treatments due to N-driven changes in herbivore populations and consumption rates. Simulated N deposition led to increased vegetative and seed biomass and decreased root:shoot ratios. Both types of herbivory caused decreases in seed biomass, reproductive allocation, and root biomass. The combined influences of N deposition and herbivory varied with plant tissue type. The positive influences of N deposition on root and seed biomass were generally suppressed by herbivory, while positive impacts of N on shoot biomass were typically not significantly suppressed by herbivory. These data suggest that in addition to substantial direct influences on plant production and allocation, N deposition may indirectly affect biomass production and allocation through affecting the rates and consequences of insect herbivory. However, these strength of these indirect effects will differ among herbivore species. The particularly strong influence of both herbivory and N deposition on A. artemisiifolia reproduction suggest potential population and community-level consequences. Copyright  OIKOS 2005.",277,2

Two types of plots were established: one fenced from reindeer grazing and trampling and one open for reindeer. The investigations in 2005 showed that lichen cover had had a significant and rapid increase (up to 8.6-fold per year). The cover of vascular plants, mainly dwarf shrubs, also increased significantly, while barren areas and the cover of litter decreased significantly during the period. Mean relative growth rate of lichen biomass was 0.083  0.011 per year in open plots, which is considered very rapid recovery compared to previous studies. Lichen recovery was significantly faster on leeward ridges than on exposed ridges, and fencing alone did not have any significant effects on lichen recovery, but in interaction with time, fencing contributed to increasing recovery rates. The lichen heath recovery was reciprocally correlated with reindeer density. In addition, lichen recovery was probably facilitated by recent climate changes, viz. shallower snow depths which made leeward tundra and forest floor vegetation accessible for reindeer, and increased summer precipitation rates which improved growth rates. The results from this study show that in a very short time there was a transition from an overexploited depauperate vegetation and barren ground state to a flourishing lichen-dominated vegetation state, suggesting that the injuries were repairable.

Therefore, understanding patterns of herbivory on plants remains a key focus in evolution and ecology. The evolutionary impacts of leaf herbivory include altering plant fitness, local adaptation, the evolution of defenses, and the diversification of plants as well as natural enemies. Leaf herbivory also impacts ecological processes such as plant productivity, community composition, and ecosystem nutrient cycling. Understanding the impact of herbivory on these ecological and evolutionary processes requires species-specific, as opposed to community-level, measures of herbivory. In addition, species-specific data enables the use of modern comparative methods to account for phylogenetic non-independence. Although hundreds of studies have measured natural rates of leaf consumption, we are unaware of any accessible compilation of these data. We created such a data set to provide the raw data needed to test general hypotheses relating to plantherbivore interactions and to test the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on herbivory rates across large spatial scales. A large repository will make this endeavor more efficient and robust.

All damage measures represent natural occurrences of herbivory that span numerous angiosperm, gymnosperm, and fern species. To enable researchers to explore the causes of variation in herbivory and how these might interact, we added information about the study sites including: geolocation, climate classification, habitat descriptions (e.g., seashore, grassland, forest, agricultural fields), and plant trait information concerning growth form and duration (e.g., annual vs. perennial). We also included extensive details of the methodology used to measure leaf damage, including seasons and months of sampling, age of leaves, and the method used to estimate percentage area missing. We anticipate that these data will make it possible to test important hypotheses in the plantherbivore literature, including the plant apparency hypothesis, the latitudinal-herbivory defense hypothesis, the resource availability hypothesis, and the macroevolutionary escalation of defense hypothesis.  2014 by the Ecological Society of America.",279,1

We conducted a field experiment testing the effects of genotypic variation, abundance, and presence/absence of green peach aphids (Myzus persicae) on the growth, leaf nitrogen, and carbon of two plant species (Brassica napus and Solanum nigrum). Aphid genotype affected B. napus but not S. nigrum biomass explaining 20 and 7% of the total variation, respectively. Averaging across both plant species, the presence/absence of aphids had a 1.6 larger effect size (Cohens d) than aphid genotype, and aphid abundance had the strongest negative effects on plant biomass explaining 29% of the total variation. On B. napus, aphid genotypes had different effects on leaf nitrogen depending on their abundance. Aphids did not influence leaf nitrogen in S. nigrum nor leaf carbon in either species. We conducted a second experiment in the field to test whether contemporary evolution could affect plant performance. Aphid populations evolved in as little as five generations, but the rate and direction of this evolution did not consistently vary between plant species. On one host species (B. napus), faster evolving populations had greater negative effects on host plant biomass, with aphid evolutionary rate explaining 23% of the variation in host plant biomass.

Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait-mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change.

Yet, while impacts of defoliation on vital rates of adult plants have been well documented, consequences for seed dispersal and seedling recruitment have been barely explored. Here, we assessed the effects of defoliation on fruit production, fruit/seed size, seed dispersal and seedling recruitment in populations of Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii, a tropical rain forest, understorey palm from Mesoamerica, whose leaves are exploited as a highly valuable non-timber forest product (NTFP). Fruit size and seed production were quantified in mature palms that were subjected to 0\% (control), 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\% experimental removal of standing leaves, applied every 6months over 2years. Seed dispersal by birds and gravity, and seed predation by small vertebrates on the ground were also quantified. Rates of seedling recruitment were recorded in non-defoliated and `sterile' populations (75\% sustained defoliation and periodical removal of all produced fruits). Finally, a stochastic model was used to quantify the overall effect of defoliation on seedlings recruited from locally (i.e. dispersed by gravity) and immigrant produced seeds (i.e. dispersed by birds). Increasing defoliation strongly reduced seed production. The probability of bird dispersal was positively correlated with fruit/seed size. Isolated (i.e. bird-dispersed) seeds endured lower predation rates than grouped (i.e. gravity-dispersed) ones. Modelling showed that seedling recruitment rate is severely reduced in highly defoliated populations due to a strong decline in the number of seedlings coming from local seed sources. Surrounding non-defoliated populations could partly compensate for this effect via seedlings coming from immigrant seeds. Synthesis. Chronic and intense defoliation negatively affects seed production and dispersal, which reduces the probability of seedling recruitment. Such effects may have a profound impact on the dynamics and genetic variability of populations, which should be taken into account when considering the effects of natural defoliation and sustainability of leaf-harvesting regimes.",284,2

It has been suggested that plants could even use entomopathogens as part of their defense strategies. In this paper, we show that Brassica oleraceae plants that are attacked by Myzus persicae aphids infected with an entomopathogenic parvovirus (M. persicae densovirus) transport the virus through the phloem locally and systematically. Moreover, healthy aphids that fed on the same leaf, but separated from infected aphids were infected via the plant.

Simulated grazing did not affect the density (flowers m2) of female (clipped: 10.94.7SD, control: 8.44.6SD) and male flowers (clipped: 20.712.0SD; control 25.616.8SD), resulting in a similar seed-set (overall average 55%) and fruit-set (overall average 44%) in clipped and control plots. Naturally turtle-grazed areas did not present significant differences in fruit size, fruit-set or seed-set from nearby ungrazed areas. Thus, T. testudinum maintained sexual production while grazed, and flowers and fruits were not a targeted food source for the green turtles. We expected incidental ingestion of the flowers, usually positioned above the cropping height of 3cm. But in the grazed areas, the flowers were shorter; being 3.6cm for female flowers, and 3.3cm for male flowers. Due to these reductions in length, the flowers and fruits were closer to the sediment than in ungrazed patches; just below the usual grazing level of the turtles. Green turtles can potentially eradicate complete meadows.

We examined if the spatial redistribution of nitrogen among habitats by cattle could restore nutrient-poor conditions in preferred foraging habitats, and conversely whether such translocation could lead to extreme eutrophication in preferred resting habitats. We used nitrogen content of different diet classes, habitat use, foraging and defecation behavior, weight gain, and nitrogen losses in the actual situation to explore four different habitat proportion scenarios and two different foraging strategies to calculate a net nitrogen balance per habitat. An atmospheric deposition of 30 kg N ha -1 yr -1 with varying interception factors according to the habitat types was included in an integrated nitrogen balance. All scenarios showed a net nitrogen transport from grassland and wooded pasture to forest habitat. We found that nitrogen redistribution strongly depends on habitat proportion. Nitrogen losses from preferred grassland habitat can be high, given its proportion is small. Depletion is only to be expected at excretion-free areas and probably is of minor importance to trigger the establishment of woody species. In general, nitrogen transported by cattle was much lower than input by atmospheric deposition, but grazing can compensate for high N inputs in excretion-free areas and maintain grassland types that support critical loads of 20-25 kg N ha -1 yr -1. In none of the scenarios, N transport by cattle resulted in the exceeding of critical nitrogen loads to vulnerable forest ground vegetation.  2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",287,2

Ultimately, insight into species-specific responses of saplings to browsing, shade and competition from neighbours will help explain diversity, structure and function of grazed ecosystems such as the endangered wood-pasture systems. We measured the survival, whole-sapling biomass and compensatory growth responses of two coniferous (Picea abies and Abies alba) and two deciduous (Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica) tree species to simulated summer browsing (one single clipping event), shade (installation of a shade cloth) and neighbour removal (mowing surrounding vegetation to ground level) treatments and the interactions between them after two-growing seasons. For all species, there were interacting effects on growth of browsing and environmental condition (shade and neighbours). Simulated browsing resulted in relatively smaller growth losses when plants were growing slowly due to competitive conditions related to herbaceous neighbours. Although none of the clipped saplings could fully compensate for their biomass losses, the saplings were closer to compensation under high competitive conditions than under low competitive conditions. Survival of the clipped saplings remained relatively high and was only significantly reduced for Picea and Acer. Picea was least tolerant of competition and was the only species for which growth was not negatively affected by strong irradiance of a mountain pasture. Surprisingly, the tolerance of saplings to herbivory as browsing tolerance was enhanced under conditions that negatively affected sapling performance (i.e. survival and growth). Apparently, the relative impact of browsing at the early sapling stage is linked to tree life history characteristics such as competition and shade tolerance and will be lower in situations with intense competitive interactions and/or strong irradiance.

In this paper we examine the relationship between plant architecture, leaf-level physiology, and leaf damage patterns by insects. We measured net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential in response to different levels of herbivory or leaf-rolling in both outer- and inner-canopy leaves. Leaf-rolling occurred naturally and was mimicked by hand-rolling leaves to different degrees. Net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential varied depending upon a combination of leaf position in the crown and degree of rolling, but not herbivory. Outer-canopy leaves had significantly higher rates of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, but lower leaf water potentials and leaf areas than inner-canopy leaves. Leaf rolling had an effect upon photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, which varied depending on whether projected areas of rolled leaves or projected areas of the leaves after they had been unrolled were considered. In both canopy layers, using unrolled projected leaf areas, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf rolling. In the outer canopy, using projected areas of rolled leaves, photosynthesis decreased while stomatal conductance increased with increasing leaf rolling. In the inner canopy, photosynthesis increased while stomatal conductance was unchanged with increasing leaf rolling. In all cases, leaf water potential increased with increasing leaf rolling. These results suggest (in order of likelihood) that either rolling creates an area of closed stomata (stomatal patchiness) proportional to the amount of rolling, or leaf specific hydraulic conductance increases, or stomata are responding to changes in the boundary layer of the leaf.",289,2

It is unclear how plant communities develop over time on these sites in clay-rich ""black cotton"" soils or how herbivores attracted to these sites affect vegetation development. I first examined whether treeless ""glades"", derived from abandoned bomas, function as nutrient and herbivore hotspots. Soil, vegetation, and herbivore data were collected on glades of varying ages. The results indicated that glades persist as long-term (four decades) patches (0.25-1.0 ha) of improved soil texture and increased nutrient levels, palatable grasses, and herbivore use. Glade vegetation also appears to undergo succession from Cynodon plectostachyus to Pennisetum stramineum dominance. Based on these patterns, exclusion cages were used to test herbivore effects on glade vegetation development. I found that large herbivores may retard succession by suppressing invasion of P. stramineum into C. plectostachyus-dominated areas. These results provide evidence that abundant anthropogenic glades function as long-term nutrient and wildlife hotspots in black cotton soils, distinct from similar hotspots in other soil types. The findings provide evidence that large herbivores can exert control over development and persistence of glades through their effects on plant community dynamics.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.",290,2

We describe a new, mechanistic model (HUNGER) that modifies a well-established mathematical formulation for plant nutrient transport and conversion processes to simulate sapling response to ungulate browsing and light availability. The HUNGER model simulates primary production, height and diameter growth, dry matter allocation, and population dynamics of tree saplings at the scale of small (e.g. 0.001 ha) regeneration patches. The model was applied to Picea abies saplings in mountain forests of eastern Switzerland after calibration based on data for sapling height growth, radial growth, and biomass components under varying light conditions. Independent data were used to test the ability of the model to represent sapling responses to browsing. The model slightly over-predicted sapling height, while no significant differences were found between simulated and observed basal diameter, total biomass or leaf biomass. Model experiments were conducted to explore the interactive effects of winter browsing intensity and relative light availability upon sapling net growth. Simulated shading effects were gradual until approximately 40% relative light availability (if browsing pressure was low) or 60% relative light availability (if browsing pressure was high). Below these values, the model simulates sharp declines in net growth rate. Model results suggest nonlinear responses to browsing and light availability, and the existence of light intensity thresholds for forest regeneration that should be relevant for management activities affecting deer density and crown cover.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in vegetation stature may affect predatorprey interactions via changes in the preys ability to detect predators, changes in predation pressure, predator identity and predator foraging strategy. Changes in productivity and vegetation composition may also affect herbivores via effects on forage availability and quality. We investigated if height-dependent effects of forage and non-forage vegetation determine burrowing extent and activity of arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). We collected data on burrow networks and activity of arctic ground squirrels across long-term vegetation monitoring sites in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska. The implications of height-specific cover of potential forage and non-forage vegetation on burrowing behaviour and habitat suitability for arctic ground squirrels were investigated using hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Increased cover of forbs was associated with more burrows and burrow systems, and higher activity of systems, for all forb heights. No other potential forage functional group was related to burrow distribution and activity. In contrast, height-dependent negative effects of non-forage vegetation were observed, with cover over 50-cm height negatively affecting the number of burrows, systems and system activity.

Small (Euphoriaceae), is one of the most aggressive weeds of coastal wetlands and forests of the southeastern United States. The lack of specialist herbivores in the invaded range may be one of the factors that contribute to the invasive nature of this weed. Chinese tallowtree has been the target of a classical biological control project since 2006. Several herbivore species are being tested for biological control of Chinese tallowtree. Concurrently, an adventive herbivore, Caloptilia triadicae Davis (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), was found feeding on Chinese tallowtree in the southeastern United States in 2004 and now occurs throughout the invaded range. Field populations of C. triadicae from two sites caused extensive mining damage to the Chinese tallowtree leaves. The greatest damage occurred after 30 d of exposure to C. triadicae in the herbivory treatment and amounted to about 25-30 leaf mines (early instars) and leaf rolls (late instars) per plant. Insecticide-treated plants had atmost 5-10 leaf mines and rolls per plant. Despite this difference, plant growth in height, number of new branches, and leaves did not differ significantly from plants protected from herbivory. Analysis of harvested plant results suggested that, in general, herbivory had little impact on biomass. However, there was a slight reduction in trunk weights in the unrestriced herbivory treatment compared with the insecticide-treated plants. Although this study exposed experimental plants to only 60 d of herbivory, these results suggested that C. triadicae alone will not exert sufficient control of invasive populations of Chinese tallowtree. Furthermore, they indicated that continued development of biological control agents that target Chinese tallowtree are needed.  2017 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.",298,2

Although grazing is the dominant land use in grasslands, little research has assessed how changes in climate might affect herbage quantity and quality, and how grazing intensity might influence these responses. We performed a fully controlled and factorial 3-yr, multisite experiment simulating climate change and grazing (via clipping). This experiment was conducted at three northern temperate grassland sites across the Canadian prairies. We increased air temperature by 2 to 4C, reduced precipitation by 60%, and clipped plants at low and high intensities. At one site, we also applied added (+60%) precipitation. We monitored changes in herbage quantity (regrowth and accumulated herbage) and one aspect of herbage quality (protein content) for both graminoid and forb components. Both climatic factors (i.e., warming and reduced precipitation) and clipping decreased season-long accumulated herbage, with similar magnitudes of response to precipitation and clipping and smaller responses to warming. Regrowth biomass following clipping declined with reduced precipitation but had a limited decline with warming. Reduced precipitation and warming both decreased herbage quality, and clipping increased quality. These results indicate that the potential for losses in herbage production under drought and warming may be exacerbated by decreased herbage quality. We also saw evidence that graminoids, rather than forbs, will be more sensitive to climate changes. Our results further support the idea that planning for altered grazing resources under future climate conditions will be necessary.  2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

The compensatory ability of an invasive plant has implications for the potential success of defoliating biocontrol agents. Mimosa compensated for 25% manual defoliation, but at 50% and 100% defoliation levels plants suffered a significant reduction in growth rate, height, stem diameter, and biomass. Defoliation by one cohort of macaria larvae, at densities of eight larvae per plant, significantly reduced growth rates and plant height after 1 week.

It has long been assumed that a plant's tolerance of herbivory should be greater in low-stress, resource-rich environments, and this assumption has been formalized in what has become known as the compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH). Despite the widespread acceptance of the CCH, recently accumulating results from numerous studies relating resource levels to tolerance of herbivory show that the relationship is not as simple as this hypothesis predicts. In fact, plants have often been found to be less tolerant of a given amount of herbivory in resource-rich environments than they are of the same amount of herbivory in resource-poor environments. In this article, we present a new model, the limiting resource model (LRM), that can more reliably explain the range of observed effects of resource levels on tolerance. The main advance of this model is that it specifically considers which factors are limiting plant fitness and which resources are affected by particular herbivores. The LRM is presented in a general and flexible form as a flowchart with seven pathways to three potential outcomes: greater tolerance, equal tolerance, or lower tolerance in low- vs high-resource environments. We then review a specific example to illustrate each of these seven pathways with a study from the published literature. We finish with a description of four general criteria to direct the design of future studies to test the predictions of the LRM. Copyright  Oikos 2005.",301,2

The prevailing model, the compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH), predicts that tolerance of herbivory should be greater in high-resource or low-competition conditions. The main rival hypothesis, the growth rate model (GRM), makes the opposite prediction: tolerance of herbivory should be greater in more stressful conditions. The tolerance predictions of a recently introduced model, the limiting resource model (LRM), are more flexible and depend on the type of resource and herbivore under consideration. We reviewed 48 studies (from 40 published articles) of plant tolerance of leaf damage in conditions differing in levels of light, inorganic nutrients, water stress, or competition. The results of 31%, 48%, and 95% of the studies were consistent with the predictions of the CCH, GRM, and LRM, respectively. Thus, by considering which resource is primarily affected by herbivory and which resource is limiting a plant's fitness, the LRM offers a substantial advance in predicting how tolerance will be affected by environmental differences in resource availability.  2007 by The University of Chicago.

We explored the influence of environmental stresses and meristem limitation on tolerance of AMD by applying the limiting resource model (LRM) of plant tolerance to 17 previously published studies and a new empirical study on Solidago altissima. In the S. altissima experiment, AMD released axillary meristems from apical dominance, and fertilizer addition enabled plants to take full advantage of the lateral branches. AMD caused a 58% reduction in seed production in nutrient-stressed plants but only a 6% reduction in seed production in fertilized plants. In 12 of the 18 studies reviewed, tolerance was greater in the high-resource (or low-competition) treatment; in two, tolerance was greater in the low-resource treatment; and in four, resource level did not affect tolerance of AMD. The results of 15 studies (83%) were consistent with LRM predictions.

We demonstrate with a simple scenario of two plant groups of equal tolerance how the choice of scales can lead one to infer that the first group is more tolerant, the second group is more tolerant, or the two groups are equally tolerant - using the identical dataset.

Identifying constraints on the evolution of increased resistance has been a major goal of researchers of plantherbivore interactions. In a glasshouse study, we measured relative costs and benefits of resistance of tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) to the gall-inducing tephritid Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed multiple ramets of 26 goldenrod genets to nutrient or shade stress and to oviposition by E.solidaginis. The presence of a gall cost a ramet an average of 1743 seeds, but the cost differed 10-fold across environments. Plant genets varied widely for an induced hypersensitive response in which meristem cells become necrotic and kill E.solidaginis hatchlings before gall induction. There was no evidence that this highly effective resistance trait carried an allocation cost. However, the response carried a risk of autotoxicity, as necrosis killed the apex of 37% of the ungalled ramets. On average, a damaged apex cost each ramet 5015 seeds. Autotoxicity may constrain the resistance of S.altissima to an intermediate level, and variation in environmental conditions may alter the relative costs and benefits of resistance and tolerance, thus maintaining genetic variation within goldenrod populations.  2017 The Authors.

Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding of the factors that control consumer regulation of vascular plants in aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plantherbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes in plant abundance would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes in plant abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions in plant abundance than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions in plant abundance than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions in plant abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change in plant abundance, with the strongest reductions in plant abundance reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions in plant abundance. Finally, we found that herbivoreplant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions in plant abundance compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions in plant abundance compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivoreplant nativeness on changes in plant abundance were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions in aquatic plant abundance are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plantherbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants.  2016 The Authors.",306,2

The plants used multiple defence traits differently in three habitats. At open sites, trichomes, pellucid dots and extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) were expressed better than at the treefall gaps, but food bodies (lipid-rich particles) were fewer. Fewer ants were observed on the plants at open sites than on plants in other habitats. Leaves collected from the open sites were consumed less by the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera litura, than leaves collected from the other habitats.

We quantified results of the included studies using the response ratio, which is the log proportional change in the means of a treatment and a control group. Four moderator variables (elevation (<1500 and 1500m above sea level); plant life form (herbaceous and woody), rainfall amount (<600mm and 600mm), rainfall modality (mono and bimodal), and soil texture (Loam, sandy, sandy loam)) appeared to affect the response of species diversity and richness patterns to different grazing regimes, i.e., communal grazing systems, exclosures, livestock ranches and game reserves. Species diversity and richness values were generally lower in the communal grazing systems compared to the other grazing regimes. Only three moderator variables (rainfall amount and modality, and soil texture) affected the herbaceous basal cover response. Differences in soil OC were highest between communal and exclosure areas, visible at high elevations and under high rainfall. Soil N was influenced by rainfall modality and soil texture.

Stress such as herbivory has the potential to cause short- and long-term changes to a plant's phenotype. In response to simulated herbivory by clipping, plants either may show lower growth and fecundity or may overcompensate and exceed the size and fecundity of undamaged individuals. This study examined the short- and long-term responses to the timing and frequency of clipping in Barbarea vulgaris. In the greenhouse, clipping resulted in elevated growth rates, and individuals eventually matched the size of undamaged individuals. In the field, clipping had negligible effects on size or fitness components. Aboveground clipping also reduced the belowground biomass. One possible explanation for the size convergence and equal fecundity despite clipping 50% of the leaves is that the belowground biomass supports the regrowth of the aboveground biomass. Stored belowground resources allowed plants to regenerate lost photosynthetic tissue. These results illustrate the ability of B. vulgaris to tolerate clipping. Regardless of the timing or frequency of clipping, plants that experienced biomass removal displayed remarkable plasticity and were able to maintain performance relative to undamaged plants.  2011 by The University of Chicago.

We conducted a common garden experiment in the introduced range of Alternanthera philoxeroides using ten invasive US and ten native Argentinean populations at two levels of light availability and in the presence or absence of a specialist stem-boring insect Agasicles hygrophila. Plant biomass (total and storage root biomass), two allocation traits (root/shoot ratio and branch intensity, branches biomass/main stem biomass) and two functional traits (specific stem length and specific leaf area), which are potentially associated with herbivore resistance and light capture, were measured. Overall, we found that A. philoxeroides from introduced ranges had comparable biomass and tolerance to specialist herbivores, lower branch intensity, lower specific stem length and specific leaf area. Moreover, introduced populations displayed higher shade tolerance of storage root biomass and lower plastic response to shading in specific stem length. Finally, light availability had no significant effect on evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores of A. philoxeroides. Our results suggest that postintroduction evolution might have occurred in A. philoxeroides. While light availability did not influence the evolution of tolerance to specialist herbivores, increased shade tolerance and release from specialist insects might have contributed to the successful invasion of A. philoxeroides.  2015 Zhang et al.

To understand how soil nutrients determine the degree of compensatory regrowth for different plant species, we selected saplings of three Ficus species and treated with herbivore insects and artificial injury in both glasshouse conditions and in the field at two soil nutrient levels. Compensatory regrowth was calculated by biomass, relative growth rate and photosynthetic characteristics. A similar pattern was found in both the glasshouse and in the field for species F. hispida, where overcompensatory regrowth was triggered only under fertile conditions, and full compensatory regrowth occurred under infertile conditions. For F. auriculata, overcompensatory regrowth was stimulated only under infertile conditions and full compensatory regrowth occurred under fertile conditions. Ficus racemosa displayed full compensatory regrowth in both soil nutrient levels, but without overcompensatory regrowth following any of the treatments. The three Ficus species differed in biomass allocation following herbivore damage and artificial injury. The root/shoot ratio of F. hispida decreased largely following herbivore damage and artificial injury, while the root/shoot ratio for F. auriculata increased against damage treatments. The increase of shoot and root size for F. hispida and F. auriculata, respectively, appeared to be caused by a significant increase in photosynthesis. The results indicated that shifts in biomass allocation and increased photosynthesis are two of the mechanisms underlying compensatory regrowth.

We assessed the general patterns and sources of variation in the effects of sap feeding on growth, photosynthesis, and reproduction of woody plants through a meta-analysis of 272 effect sizes calculated from 52 papers. Sap-feeders significantly reduced growth (-29%), reproduction (-17%), and photosynthesis (-27%); seedlings suffered more than saplings and mature trees. Deciduous and evergreen woody plants did not differ in their abilities to tolerate damage imposed by sap-feeders. Different plant parts, in particular below- and above-ground organs, responded similarly to damage, indicating that sap-feeders did not change the resource allocation in plants. The strongest effects were caused by mesophyll and phloem feeders, and the weakest by xylem feeders. Generalist sap-feeders reduced plant performance to a greater extent than did specialists. Methodology substantially influenced the outcomes of the primary studies; experiments conducted in greenhouses yielded stronger negative effects than field experiments; shorter (<12 months) experiments showed bigger growth reduction in response to sap feeding than longer experiments; natural levels of herbivory caused weaker effects than infestation of experimental plants by sap-feeders. Studies conducted at higher temperatures yielded stronger detrimental effects of sap-feeders on their hosts. We conclude that sap-feeders impose a more severe overall negative impact on plant performance than do defoliators, mostly due to the lower abilities of woody plants to compensate for sap-feeders' damage in terms of both growth and photosynthesis.

On average, belowground herbivory led to a 36.3% loss of root biomass, which was accompanied by a reduction in aboveground growth (-16.3%), photosynthesis (-11.7%) and reproduction (-15.5%). The effects of root herbivory on aboveground plant characteristics were significant in agricultural and biological control studies, but not in studies of natural systems. Experiments conducted in controlled environments yielded larger effects on plants than field experiments, and infestation experiments resulted in more severe effects than removal studies employing natural levels of herbivory. Simulated root herbivory led to greater aboveground growth reductions than similar root loss imposed by insect feeding. External root chewers caused stronger detrimental effects than sap feeders or root borers; specialist herbivores imposed milder adverse effects on plants than generalists. Woody plants suffered from root herbivory more than herbaceous plants, although root loss was similar in these two groups. Evergreen woody plants responded to root herbivory more strongly than deciduous woody plants, and grasses suffered from root herbivory more than herbs. Environmental factors such as drought, poor nutrient supply, among-plant competition, and aboveground herbivory increased the adverse effects of root damage on plants in an additive manner. In general, plant tolerance to root herbivores is lower than tolerance to defoliating aboveground herbivores.  2011 Springer-Verlag.",316,2
