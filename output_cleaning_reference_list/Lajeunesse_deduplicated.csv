A model-oriented meta-analysis","Baig, S. and Medlyn, B.E. and Mercado, L.M. and Zaehle, S.","Global Change Biology","13541013","21","4303-4319","2015","10.1111/gcb.12962","The temperature dependence of the reaction kinetics of the Rubisco enzyme implies that, at the level of a chloroplast, the response of photosynthesis to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) will increase with increasing air temperature. Vegetation models incorporating this interaction predict that the response of net primary productivity (NPP) to elevated CO2 (eCa) will increase with rising temperature and will be substantially larger in warm tropical forests than in cold boreal forests. We tested these model predictions against evidence from eCa experiments by carrying out two meta-analyses. Firstly, we tested for an interaction effect on growth responses in factorial eCa  temperature experiments. This analysis showed a positive, but nonsignificant interaction effect (95% CI for above-ground biomass response = -0.8, 18.0%) between eCa and temperature. Secondly, we tested field-based eCa experiments on woody plants across the globe for a relationship between the eCa effect on plant biomass and mean annual temperature (MAT). This second analysis showed a positive but nonsignificant correlation between the eCa response and MAT. The magnitude of the interactions between CO2 and temperature found in both meta-analyses were consistent with model predictions, even though both analyses gave nonsignificant results. Thus, we conclude that it is not possible to distinguish between the competing hypotheses of no interaction vs. an interaction based on Rubisco kinetics from the available experimental database. Experiments in a wider range of temperature zones are required. Until such experimental data are available, model predictions should aim to incorporate uncertainty about this interaction.  2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",1,2

Across taxa, host longevity, timing of maturity, and reproductive effort affect the organization of immune systems. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that these and related factors should also affect immune activation costs. Specifically, species that spread their breeding efforts over a long lifetime should experience lower immune costs than those that mature and breed quickly and die comparatively early. Likewise, body mass should affect immune costs, as body size affects the extent to which hosts are exposed to parasites as well as how hosts can combat infections (via its effects on metabolic rates and other factors). Here, we used phylogenetic meta-regression to reveal that, in general, animals incur costs of immune activation, but small species that are relatively long-lived incur the largest costs. These patterns probably arise because of the relative need for defense when infection risk is comparatively high and fitness can only be realized over a comparatively long period. However, given the diversity of species considered here and the overall modest effects of body mass and life history on immune costs, much more research is necessary before generalizations are appropriate.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2,2

However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of SOC stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe. Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods <30 years and >30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.  2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",3,2

Although this hypothesis was supported by a recent meta-analysis, we believe that the meta-analytic calculation used was not appropriate to test the stated hypothesis. Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and CO2 interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive effect and CO2 has a negative effect on both growth and calcification. For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO2 impacts. Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope upon which CO2 effects can act in food-replete situations. These interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic approach. Ongoing changes in food supply and carbonate chemistry, coupled with under-described, poorly understood, and potentially surprising interactive outcomes for these two variables, suggest that the role of food should remain a priority in ocean acidification research.

While known to influence soil carbon (C) cycling, it remains unresolved if altered rainfall patterns induced by climate change will stimulate positive feedbacks of CO2 into the atmosphere. Using a meta-analysis frame-work including 1495 observations from 60 studies encompassing a variety of ecosystems and soil types, we investigated drought effects on respiration rates, cumulative respiration during drying-rewetting cycles, metabolic quotient (qCO2), dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass and fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratios from laboratory and field experiments. We show that C-rich soils (&gt;2% organic carbon) increase CO2 release into the atmosphere after intense droughts, but that C-poor soils show a net decline in C losses. We explain this self-reinforcing mechanism of climate change in C-rich soils by: (i) high substrate availability that magnify bursts of CO2 release after drought events and (ii) a shift in microbial community with increased loss of C per unit of biomass. These findings shed light on important responses of soil CO2 emissions to drought, which could either offset or facilitate positive feedbacks to global warming. Our results should be considered in global climate models, as even small changes in soil CO2 emission have large repercussions for global warming.  2017 Elsevier Ltd",5,2

Symbiotic relationship between plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread and are well known to ameliorate the influence of salinity stress on agro-ecosystem. In the present study, we sought to understand the phenomenon of variability on AMF symbiotic relationship on saline stress amelioration in C3 and C4 plants. Thus, the objective was to compare varied mycorrhizal symbiotic relationship between C3 and C4 plants in saline conditions. To accomplish the above mentioned objective, we conducted a random effects models meta-analysis across 60 published studies. An effect size was calculated as the difference in mycorrhizal responses between the AMF inoculated plants and its corresponding control under saline conditions. Responses were compared between (i) identity of AMF species and AMF inoculation, (ii) identity of host plants (C3 vs. C4) and plant functional groups, (iii) soil texture and level of salinity and (iv) experimental condition (greenhouse vs. field). Results indicate that both C3 and C4 plants under saline condition responded positively to AMF inoculation, thereby overcoming the predicted effects of symbiotic efficiency. Although C3 and C4 plants showed positive effects under low (EC &lt; 4 ds/m) and high (&gt;8 ds/m) saline conditions, C3 plants showed significant effects for mycorrhizal inoculation over C4 plants. Among the plant types, C4 annual and perennial plants, C4 herbs and C4 dicot had a significant effect over other counterparts. Between single and mixed AMF inoculants, single inoculants Rhizophagus irregularis had a positive effect on C3 plants whereas Funneliformis mosseae had a positive effect on C4 plants than other species. In all of the observed studies, mycorrhizal inoculation showed positive effects on shoot, root and total biomass, and in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (K) uptake. However, it showed negative effects in sodium (Na) uptake in both C3 and C4 plants. This influence, owing to mycorrhizal inoculation, was significantly higher in K uptake in C4 plants. For our analysis, we concluded that AMF-inoculated C4 plants showed more competitive K+ ions uptake than C3 plants. Therefore, maintenance of high cytosolic K+/Na+ ratio is a key feature of plant salt tolerance. Studies on the detailed mechanism for the selective transport of K in C3 and C4 mycorrhizal plants under salt stress is lacking, and this needs to be explored.  2016 Chandrasekaran, Kim, Krishnamoorthy, Walitang, Sundaram, Joe, Selvakumar, Hu, Oh and Sa.",6,3

However, a quantitative research synthesis has not been conducted on the role of BCAs in disease suppression. Therefore, the present study aimed to meta-analyze the impacts of BCAs on both Ralstonia wilt disease suppression and plant (host) growth promotion. The analysis showed that the extent of disease suppression by BCAs varied widely among studies, with effect size (log response ratio) ranging from 2.84 to 2.13. The disease incidence and severity were significantly decreased on average by 53.7% and 49.3%, respectively. BCAs inoculation also significantly increased fresh and dry weight by 34.4% and 36.1%, respectively on average. Also, BCAs inoculation significantly increased plant yield by 66%. Mean effect sizes for genus Pseudomonas sp. as BCAs were higher than for genus Bacillus spp. Among antagonists tested, P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cereus, B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens were found to be more effective in general for disease reduction. Across studies, highest disease control was found for P. fluorescens, annual plants, co-inoculation with more than one BCA, soil drench and greenhouse condition were found to be essential in understanding plant responses to R. solanacearum. Our results suggest that more efforts should be devoted to harnessing the potential beneficial effects of these antagonists, not just for plant growth promoting traits but also in mode of applications, BCAs formulations and their field studies should be considered in the future for R. solanacearum wilt disease suppression.

However, researchers still lack a comprehensive framework that can predict responses to climate change globally and across diverse taxa. Here, we synthesize hundreds of published time series of animal phenology from across the planet to show that temperature primarily drives phenological responses at mid-latitudes, with precipitation becoming important at lower latitudes, probably reflecting factors that drive seasonality in each region. Phylogeny and body size are associated with the strength of phenological shifts, suggesting emerging asynchronies between interacting species that differ in body size, such as hosts and parasites and predators and prey. Finally, although there are many compelling biological explanations for spring phenological delays, some examples of delays are associated with short annual records that are prone to sampling error.

In marine systems, saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitatscollectively known as blue carbon and coastal vegetated habitats (CVHs)are a leading sequester of global C and increasingly impacted by exotic species invasions. There is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in invaded CVHs amounting to 40% (16%) higher C storage than uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders. Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal systems.

We used meta-analysis to explore fire effects on N and P concentrations in aboveground plant biomass among a variety of plants and plant communities worldwide. We show that across all observations, fire enhanced N concentration in plants when N/P ratios in biomass were low, and enhanced P concentration in plants when biomass N/P ratios were high. P concentration increased particularly in woody plants. Furthermore, responses of the N/P ratio in woody plants were more flexible than in herbaceous plants so that fire eased N and P imbalances only in woody plants.

In plants, broader niches are often hypothesized to be due to pronounced phenotypic plasticity, and more plastic species are therefore predicted to be more common. We examined the relationship between the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity in five functional traits, mainly related to leaves, and several measures of abundance in 105 Central European grassland species. We further tested whether mean values of traits, rather than their plasticity, better explain the commonness of species, possibly because they are pre-adapted to exploiting the most common resources. Location: Central Europe. Methods: In a multispecies experiment with 105 species we measured leaf thickness, leaf greenness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and plant height, and the plasticity of these traits in response to fertilization, waterlogging and shading. For the same species we also obtained five measures of commonness, ranging from plot-level abundance to range size in Europe. We then examined whether these measures of commonness were associated with the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity, expressed as composite plasticity of all traits across the experimental treatments. We further estimated the relative importance of trait plasticity and trait means for abundance and geographical range size. Results: More abundant species were less plastic. This negative relationship was fairly consistent across several spatial scales of commonness, but it was weak. Indeed, compared with trait means, plasticity was relatively unimportant for explaining differences in species commonness. Main conclusions: Our results do not indicate that larger phenotypic plasticity of leaf morphological traits enhances species abundance. Furthermore, possession of a particular trait value, rather than of trait plasticity, is a more important determinant of species commonness.  2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",15,2

Here, we test whether there is such a relationship for plasticity in leaf functional traits. Location: Central Europe. Methods: We surveyed 110132 grassland plant species for plasticity in five leaf traits [leaf thickness, leaf greenness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and plant height] and for biomass changes in response to experimental fertilization, shading and waterlogging. Trait plasticity and changes in biomass were compared with species niche characteristics along three environmental axes (light, nutrient and soil moisture) derived from a vegetation-plot database. Results: Although response of several traits to experimental treatments correlated with niche position and breadth (change in leaf thickness, greenness and biomass in response to fertilization; change in LDMC due to shading; and change in plant height and biomass due to waterlogging), we did not find evidence that species with broader niches or species from resource-rich environments are more plastic. Ecological generalists even turned out to be less plastic in some traits, including leaf thickness after fertilization and waterlogging. Generalists also displayed smaller plastic response averaged across all five traits (composite plasticity), though the relationship was not statistically significant. This composite plasticity was positively related to absolute change in biomass in all experimental treatments. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that larger species-level plasticity in leaf traits is not necessarily associated with a capacity to occupy a broader range of environments or with growth in resource-rich habitats; rather, it may indicate species sensitivity to environmental changes.  2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",16,2

For a reduced dataset (n = 542), we developed a mixed-effect model (meta-regression) to explore the observed variability in REs for the chemicals using three chemical specific factors and four WWTP-related parameters. The overall removal efficiency of the set of chemicals was 82.1% (95% CI 75.2-87.1%, N = 1539). Our model accounted for 17% of the total variability in REs, while the process-based model SimpleTreat did not perform better than the average of the measured REs. We identified that, after accounting for other factors potentially influencing RE, readily biodegradable compounds were better removed than non-readily biodegradable ones. Further, we showed that REs increased with increasing sludge retention times (SRTs), especially for non-readily biodegradable compounds. Finally, our model highlighted a decrease in RE with increasing KOC. The counterintuitive relationship to KOC stresses the need for a better understanding of electrochemical interactions influencing the RE of ionisable chemicals. In addition, we highlighted the need to improve the modelling of chemicals that undergo deconjugation when predicting RE.

Sampling site was the major factor affecting soil enzymatic profile and accounted for 34.25% of the overall impact. The availabilities of Pb, La, Ni, Co, Fe and Al were significantly higher in soil with only chemical fertilizer than the soil with organic amendment. Most of the soil enzyme activities, including -glucosidase activity, were significantly activated by organic amendment. Network analysis between the soil ionome and the soil enzyme activities was more complex in the organic-amended soils than in the chemical fertilized soils, whereas the network analysis among the soil ions was less complex with organic amendment. Moreover, -glucosidase was revealed to generally harbor more corrections with the soil ionic availabilities in network. We concluded that some of the soil enzymes activated by organic input can make the soil more vigorous and stable and that the -glucosidase revealed by this analysis might help stabilize the soil ion availability.",18,3

Eelgrass is a valuable and protected nearshore habitat. It is important to understand how bivalve aquaculture interacts with eelgrass to support the sustainable development of this globally expanding industry. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the positive and negative effects of bivalve aquaculture on eelgrass by conducting the first quantitative, global meta-analysis of aquaculture-eelgrass studies. A literature review resulted in 125 studies that met established criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The meta-analysis determined: (1) how eelgrass responds to on-bottom and off-bottom bivalve aquaculture, (2) how these responses vary between regions and specific grow-out methods, and (3) the resilience of eelgrass after harvesting disturbances. On-bottom culture (laying directly on the sediment potentially including predator exclusion devices) corresponded to significant increases in eelgrass growth and reproduction, and a decrease in density and biomass. Off-bottom culture (e.g., longline and suspended bag) resulted in significant decreases in eelgrass density, percent cover, and reproduction. Results support a space-competition hypothesis for on-bottom culture and provide limited support for light limitation in off-bottom culture, although other mechanisms of interaction are potentially occurring as well. A US west coast case study revealed regional differences in eelgrass responses, including a more negative trend in eelgrass density from off-bottom culture, and a neutral effect on reproduction from on-bottom culture (relative to neutral and positive trend, respectively, in the average of all other studies). Eelgrass densities recovered after all harvest methods, however mechanical harvest methods created greater initial impact and longer recovery times than manual harvest methods. The time-period over which observations were reported was an important variable that was not included in the analysis but could influence these results. These analyses suggest the response of eelgrass to bivalve aquaculture varies depending on eelgrass characteristics, grow-out approaches, and harvesting methods, with potential regionally specific relationships. Questions remain, regarding how this dynamic relationship between eelgrass and aquaculture habitat relates to ecological functions and services in the nearshore environment.  2018",19,2

The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been detected in almost 700 different amphibian species and is implicated in numerous global amphibian population declines. Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system-those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others-is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history, habitat use, and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities, whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure. Affiliation with ephemeral aquatic habitat and breadth of habitat use were strong predictors of vulnerability to and intensity of infection and several other traits including body size, lifespan, age at sexual maturity, and geographic range also appeared in top models explaining host responses to Bd. Several of the species examined are highly understudied with respect to Bd such that this study represents the first experimental susceptibility data. Combining insights gained from experimental studies with observations of landscapelevel disease prevalence may help explain current and predict future pathogen dynamics in the Bd system.",21,3

Despite the inhibitory toxic pollutants, GeoChip 5.0 detected almost all key functional gene (average 61,940 genes) categories in the coking wastewater sludge. With higher abundance, aromatic ring cleavage dioxygenase genes including multi ring1,2diox; one ring2,3diox; catechol represented significant functional potential for degradation of aromatic pollutants which was further confirmed by Illumina HiSeq2500 analysis results. Response ratio analysis revealed that three nitrogenous compound degrading genes- nbzA (nitro-aromatics), tdnB (aniline), and scnABC (thiocyanate) were unique for coking wastewater treatment, which might be strong cause to increase ammonia level during the aerobic process. Additionally, HiSeq2500 elucidated carbozole and isoquinoline degradation genes in the system.

Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (15%) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture.

The concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, which is inspired by the Fry paradigm of a bell-shaped increase-optimum-decrease-type response of aerobic scope to increasing temperature, but also includes proposed negative and synergistic effects of elevated CO2 levels, has been suggested as a unifying framework. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to assess the following: (i) the generality of a bell-shaped relationship between absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and temperature; (ii) to what extent elevated CO2 affects resting oxygen uptake MO2rest and AAS; and (iii) whether there is an interaction between elevated temperature and CO2. The behavioural effects of CO2 are also briefly discussed. In 31 out of 73 data sets (both acutely exposed and acclimated), AAS increased and remained above 90% of the maximum, whereas a clear thermal optimum was observed in the remaining 42 data sets. Carbon dioxide caused a significant rise in MO2rest in only 18 out of 125 data sets, and a decrease in 25, whereas it caused a decrease in AAS in four out of 18 data sets and an increase in two. The analysis did not reveal clear evidence for an overall correlation with temperature, CO2 regime or duration of CO2 treatment. When CO2 had an effect, additive rather than synergistic interactions with temperature were most common and, interestingly, they even interacted antagonistically on MO2rest and AAS. The behavioural effects of CO2 could complicate experimental determination of respiratory performance. Overall, this meta-analysis reveals heterogeneity in the responses to elevated temperature and CO2 that is not in accordance with the idea of a single unifying principle and which cannot be ignored in attempts to model and predict the impacts of global warming and ocean acidification on marine ectotherms.

This study quantifies the effects of CR incorporation on SOC and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O) in Europe using data from long-term experiments. Response ratios (RRs) for SOC and GHG emissions were calculated between CR incorporation and removal. The influence of environmental zones (ENZs), clay content and experiment duration on the RRs was investigated. We also studied how RRs of SOC and crop yields were correlated. A total of 475 RRs were derived from 39 publications. The SOC increased by 7% following CR incorporation. In contrast, in a subsample of cases, CO2 emissions were six times and N2O emissions 12 times higher following CR incorporation. The ENZ had no significant influence on RRs. For SOC concentration, soils with a clay content &gt;35% showed 8% higher RRs compared with soils with clay contents between 18 and 35%. As the experiment progressed, RR for SOC concentration increased. For N2O emissions, RR was significantly greater in experiments with a duration &lt;5 yr compared with 11-20 yr. No significant correlations were found between RR for SOC concentration and yields, but differences between sites and study durations were detected. We suggest that a long duration of crop residue incorporation is a win-win scenario under a continental climate.

Here we quantitatively analyzed the importance of experimental settings as well as biotic and abiotic factors for the effectiveness of AMF to stabilize soil macroaggregates. Methods: We gathered 35 studies on AMF and soil aggregation and tested 13 predictor variables for their relevance with a boosted regression tree analysis and performed a meta-analysis, fitting individual random effects models for each variable. Results and conclusions: The overall mean effect of inoculation with AMF on soil aggregation was positive and predictor variable means were all in the range of beneficial effects. Pot studies and studies with sterilized sandy soil, near neutral soil pH, a pot size smaller than 2.5 kg and a duration between 2.2 and 5 months were more likely to result in stronger effects of AMF on soil aggregation than experiments in the field, with non-sterilized or fine textured soil or an acidic pH. This is the first study to quantitatively show that the effect of AMF inoculation on soil aggregation is positive and context dependent.

Here, we focus on horticulture (fruits and vegetables) and we refine our knowledge by characterising the distributions of organic and conventional yields both in terms of average yield loss and in terms of variability across experiments and across years. We built a new dataset including 636 ratios of organic versus conventional yields covering 37 horticultural species and 17 countries and estimated (i) mean yield ratios, (ii) yield ratio probability distribution across experiments and (iii) interannual yield variances in organic and conventional systems. Our results show that yields in organic horticulture are indeed on average 10 to 32% lower than those in conventional horticulture but they exhibit large variation across experiments. An analysis of yield ratio probability distribution shows that yield loss in organic horticulture has about 10% chances to exceed 50% compared to conventional systems. The analysis gives also around 20% chances to get higher yields in organic horticulture compared to conventional systems. None of the tested covariates (e.g. crop type, climate zone) was able to explain a significant part of the yield ratio variability. We find no evidence of a larger interannual variability (i.e. lower yield stability) in organic versus conventional horticulture. Longer-term trials could nonetheless help substantiate this result.

Climate change is predicted to cause further rise of cyanobacteria blooms as cyanobacteria can have a competitive advantage at elevated temperatures. We tested the hypothesis that simultaneous rise in nutrients and temperature will promote cyanobacteria more than a single increase in one of the two drivers. To this end, controlled experiments were run with seston from 39 different urban water bodies varying in trophic state from mesotrophic to hypertrophic. These experiments were carried out at two different temperatures, 20C (ambient) and 25C (warming scenario) with or without the addition of a surplus of nutrients (eutrophication scenario). To facilitate comparisons, we quantified the effect size of the different treatments, using cyanobacterial and algal chlorophyll a concentrations as a response variable. Cyanobacterial and algal chlorophyll a concentrations were determined with a PHYTO-PAM phytoplankton analyzer. Warming caused an 18% increase in cyanobacterial chlorophyll-, while algal chlorophyll- concentrations were on average 8% higher at 25C than at 20C. A nutrient pulse had a much stronger effect on chlorophyll- concentrations than warming. Cyanobacterial chlorophyll- concentrations in nutrient enriched incubations at 20 or 25C were similar and 9 times higher than in the incubations without nutrient pulse. Likewise, algal chlorophyll- concentrations were 6 times higher. The results of this study confirm that warming alone yields marginally higher cyanobacteria chlorophyll- concentrations, yet that a pulse of additional nutrients is boosting blooms. The responses of seston originating from mesotrophic waters seemed less strong than those from eutrophic waters, which indicates that nutrient control strategies -catchment as well as in-system measures- could increase the resilience of surface waters to the negative effects of climate change.  2018 Lrling, Mendes e Mello, van Oosterhout, de Senerpont Domis and Marinho.",36,3

Meta-analysis in biological sciences, especially in ecology and evolution (which we refer to as 'biological' meta-analysis) faces somewhat different methodological problems from its counterparts in medical and social sciences, where meta-analytic techniques were originally developed. The main reason for such differences is that biological meta-analysis often integrates complex data composed of multiple strata with, for example, different measurements and a variety of species. Here, we review methodological issues and advancements in biological meta-analysis, focusing on three topics: (1) non-independence arising from multiple effect sizes obtained in single studies and from phylogenetic relatedness, (2) detecting and accounting for heterogeneity, and (3) identifying publication bias and measuring its impact. We show how the marriage between mixed-effects (hierarchical/multilevel) models and phylogenetic comparative methods has resolved most of the issues under discussion. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of across-study and within-study meta-analysis, and propose how the use of within-study meta-analysis can improve many empirical studies typical of ecology and evolution.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",37,2

As alternatives to traditional toxicity testing have emerged, the agency has been faced with additional questions about how to incorporate data from such tests into its chemical assessments and whether such tests can replace some traditional testing methods. Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) have raised concerns that traditional toxicity-testing protocols might be inadequate to identify all potential hazards to human health because they have the ability to modulate normal hormone function, and small alterations in hormone concentrations, particularly during sensitive life stages, can have lasting and significant effects.

Thus, farming systems that are both highly productive and minimize environmental harms are critically needed. Howorganic agriculture may contribute to world food production has been subject to vigorous debate over the past decade. Here, we revisit this topic comparing organic and conventional yields with a new meta-dataset three times larger than previously used (115 studies containing more than 1000 observations) and a new hierarchical analytical framework that can better account for the heterogeneity and structure in the data. We find organic yields are only 19.2% (3.7%) lower than conventional yields, a smaller yield gap than previous estimates. More importantly, we find entirely different effects of crop types and management practices on the yield gap compared with previous studies. For example, we found no significant differences in yields for leguminous versus non-leguminous crops, perennials versus annuals or developed versus developing countries. Instead, we found the novel result that two agricultural diversification practices, multi-cropping and crop rotations, substantially reduce the yield gap (to 94% and 85%, respectively) when the methods were applied in only organic systems. These promising results, based on robust analysis of a larger meta-dataset, suggest that appropriate investment in agroecological research to improve organic management systems could greatly reduce or eliminate the yield gap for some crops or regions.  2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

One conventional explanation for sex differences in mercury burden suggests female birds should have lower concentrations than conspecific males, because breeding females can depurate methylmercury to their eggs. However, sex differences in body burden of mercury among birds are not consistent. We used meta-analysis to synthesize 123 male-female comparisons of mercury burden from 50 studies. For breeding birds, males had higher concentrations of mercury than did females, supporting egg depuration as a mechanism. However, the percentage of female body mass represented by a clutch did not significantly predict the magnitude of the sex difference in mercury contamination, as predicted. Furthermore, whether species were semialtrical or altrical versus semiprecocial or precocial also did not explain sex differences in mercury burden. Foraging guild of a species did explain near significant variation in sex differences in mercury burden where piscivores and invertivores showed significant sex differences, but sex differences were not detected for carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, and omnivores. The magnitude and direction of sexual size dimorphism did not explain variation in sex differences in mercury burden among breeding birds.

We evaluated the degree to which plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) improve plant performance with and without drought stress. Methods: We used meta-analysis to summarize 52 published articles on the effects of PGPR on root mass, shoot mass and yield under well-watered and drought conditions. We also asked whether fertilization treatments, experimental conditions, inoculum taxonomic complexity, plant functional group, or inoculum delivery method introduce variation in the effect size of PGPR. Results: Across all treatments, plants were highly responsive to PGPR; under well-watered conditions, root mass increased by 35%, shoot mass increased by 28%, and reproductive yield increased by 19%. Under drought conditions, the effect was even higher: root mass increased by 43%, shoot mass increased by 45%, and reproductive yield increased by 40%. The effect of PGPR was significantly larger under drought for shoot mass (p&lt;0.05) and reproductive yield (p&lt;0.05), but not for root mass. PGPR responsiveness also varied according to plant functional group, with C3 grass shoot production responding the least strongly to PGPR. Conclusions: We demonstrate that PGPR are highly effective for improving plant growth, with a greater effect under drought for above ground traits. While previously known for their bio-control abilities, we show that PGPR may also contribute to drought amelioration and water conservation.  2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",43,2

The model hypothesizes that faking is a phenomenon of homogenization of scores, consisting of a double mechanism that increases the mean, on one hand, and decreases the standard deviation of distributions of scores, on the other. Subsequently, this affects the covariance, reliability, and validity of assessment procedures negatively. The model predicts that a mean ratio (faking ratio) greater than 1 and a coefficient of homogeneity u smaller than 1 characterizes faking. Meta-analysis was used to test several predictions of the theoretical model in the case of the personality measures. A database of 46 independent studies was created. All the studies used the NEO-PI-R for assessing the Big Five and their facets. The general pattern of data fully supported the model predictions.

A recent synthesis addressing this issue found conflicting evidence for the relationship between diet breadth and mean individual fitness. Specifically, it found that while, on average, a mixed diet does increase mean fitness, in some instances, a single food provides equal (or higher) fitness than a mixed diet. Critical to ecological and evolutionary considerations of diet, however, is not only mean fitness but also variance in fitness. We combine contemporary meta-analytic methods with models of nutritional geometry to evaluate how diet affects between-individual variance in fitness within generalist consumers froma range of trophic levels. As predicted by nutritional geometry, we found that between-individual variance in fitness-related traits is higher on single-food than mixed diets. The effect was strong for longevity traits (57% higher) and reproductive traits (37%) and present but weaker for size-related traits (10%). Further, the effect became stronger as the number of available foods increased. The availability ofmultiple foods likely allows individuals with differing nutritional optima to customize intake, each maximizing their own fitness. Importantly, these findings may suggest that selection on traits correlated with nutritional requirements is weak in heterogeneous nutritional environments.  2015 by The University of Chicago.",46,2

Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35%, and reduced overall activity by 72%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management.  2016 Elsevier B.V.",47,1

Given the substantial cost of fouling removal, some have questioned the necessity of biofouling mitigation strategies. Meta-analysis revealed that biofouling typically reduces shellfish fitness. However, the fitness of treated stock was often lower or equal to fouled control stock, indicating that many common antifouling (AF) strategies are ineffective at enhancing farm productivity.

Despite a wealth of research on how animals respond to anthropogenic changes to natural wetlands and how they use created wetlands, we lack a broad synthesis of these data. While some altered wetlands may provide vital habitat, others could pose a considerable risk to wildlife. This risk will be heightened if such wetlands are ecological trapspreferred habitats that confer lower fitness than another available habitat. Wetlands functioning as ecological traps could decrease both local and regional population persistence, and ultimately lead to extinctions. Most studies have examined how animals respond to changes in environmental conditions by measuring responses at the community and population levels, but studying ecological traps requires information on fitness and habitat preferences. Our current lack of knowledge of individual-level responses may therefore limit our capacity to manage wetland ecosystems effectively since ecological traps require different management practices to mitigate potential consequences. We conducted a global meta-analysis to characterise how animals respond to four key drivers of wetland alteration: agriculture, mining, restoration and urbanisation. Our overarching goal was to evaluate the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems, as well as identify current knowledge gaps that limit both the current understanding of these responses and effective wetland management. We extracted 1799 taxon-specific response ratios from 271 studies across 29 countries. Community- (e.g. richness) and population-level (e.g. density) measures within altered wetlands were largely comparable to those within reference wetlands. By contrast, individual fitness measures (e.g. survival) were often lower, highlighting the potential limitations of using only community- and population-level measures to assess habitat quality. Only four studies provided habitat-preference data, preventing investigation of the potential for altered wetlands to function as ecological traps. This is concerning because attempts to identify ecological traps may detect previously unidentified conservation risks. Although there was considerable variability amongst taxa, amphibians were typically the most sensitive taxon, and thus, may be a valuable bio-indicator of wetland quality. Despite suffering reduced survival and reproduction, measures such as time to and mass at metamorphosis were similar between altered and reference wetlands, suggesting that quantifying metamorphosis-related measures in isolation may not provide accurate information on habitat quality. Our review provides the most detailed evaluation to date of the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems. We emphasise that the role of wetlands in human-altered ecosystems can be complex, as they may represent important habitat but also pose potential risks to animals. Reduced availability of natural wetlands is increasing the importance of altered wetlands for aquatic animals. Consequently, we need to define what represents habitat quality from the perspective of animals, and gain a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of habitat selection and how these factors could be manipulated. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the quality of these wetlands should be implemented to maximise their conservation potential.  2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society",49,2

Despite substantial advances in adapting meta-analytical techniques for use in ecological sciences from their foundations in medical and social sciences, forest biodiversity research still presents particular challenges to its application. These relate to the long timescales of successional stages, often precluding experimental designs, and the often-large spatial scales required to select random plots for sampling treatment factors of interest. Empirical studies measuring biodiversity responses to forest treatments vary widely in their quality with respect to the number of treatment replicates and the randomness of their allocation to treatment levels, with a high prevalence of pseudoreplicated designs. It has been suggested that meta-analysis can potentially offer a solution to the vast pseudoreplicated literature, because results from pseudoreplicated studies are formative collectively. Here we review the principal issues that arise when including differently designed studies in meta-analyses of forest biodiversity responses to forest management or disturbance, in addition to more general matters of appropriate question formulation and interpretation of synthetic findings. These concern the need for questions of practical value to forest management, appropriate effect size estimation and weighting of primary studies that differ in study design and quality. We recommend against using effect sizes that are standardized against within-study variance when pooling studies across different designs or across factors such as taxonomic group. We find a need for alternative weighting schemes to the conventional inverse of study variance, to account for variation between studies in their design quality as well as their observed precision. Finally, we recommend caution in interpreting results, particularly with regard to the possibility of systematic biases between reference and treatment stands.  2017 The Authors",50,2

Overall, hairy vetchcereal rye mixtures produced 63 and 21% more biomass compared with hairy vetch and cereal rye monocultures, respectively. The N content of hairy vetchcereal rye mixtures was 150% greater than that of cereal rye monocultures. When the proportion of hairy vetch seeds (by weight) exceeded 46% of the mixture, the mixtures accumulated equivalent or more N than the greatest yielding monocultures (usually hairy vetch). Compared with monocultures, a more consistent positive response of mixtures on biomass and N content was found on coarse-textured soils and following corn (Zea mays L.) rather than soybean [Glycine max (L.)

With increasing growing degree days (GDD), the biomass and N content of mixtures decreased relative to hairy vetch monocultures but increased relative to cereal rye monocultures, suggesting better performance of hairy vetch at higher GDD.

Plant-derived inputs can accumulate in the soil and become part of the soil C pool (new soil C), or accelerate losses of pre-existing (old) soil C. The dynamics of the new and old pools will likely differ and alter the long-term fate of soil C, but these separate pools, which can be distinguished through isotopic labeling, have not been considered in past syntheses. Using meta-analysis, we found that while elevated CO2 (ranging from 550 to 800 parts per million by volume) stimulates the accumulation of new soil C in the short term (&lt;1year), these effects do not persist in the longer term (14years). Elevated CO2 does not affect the decomposition or the size of the old soil C pool over either temporal scale. Our results are inconsistent with predictions of conventional soil C models and suggest that elevated CO2 might increase turnover rates of new soil C. Because increased turnover rates of new soil C limit the potential for additional soil C sequestration, the capacity of land ecosystems to slow the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may be smaller than previously assumed.  2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",52,2

In this study, we experimentally quantified feeding rates of males and females in copepods with different feeding behavior: ambush feeding (Oithona nana), feeding-current feeding (Temora longicornis) and cruising feeding (Centropages hamatus). We hypothesize that carbon-specific maximum ingestion rates are similar between genders, but that maximum clearance rates are lower for male copepods, particularly in ambush feeders, where the males must sacrifice feeding for mate searching. We conducted gender-specific functional feeding response experiments using prey of different size and motility. In most cases, gender-specific maximum ingestion and clearance rates were largely explained by the difference in size between sexes, independent of the feeding strategy. However, maximum clearance rates of males were approximately two times higher than for females in the ambush feeding copepod O. nana feeding on an optimal motile prey (Oxyrrhis marina), as hypothesized. We conclude that the conflict between mate searching and feeding can cause significant difference in feeding efficiency between copepod genders in ambush feeders but not in feeding-current and cruising feeders.

This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and >16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5-261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.",55,3

Context: To cope with global warming, the majority of plants have either to migrate polewards or risk extinction. This is why conservationists value predictive models that can flag plant species that may not keep pace with global warming. Aims: To identify which plant traits best explain migration potential in woody species by reanalysing a dataset of tree distribution ranges in Europe. Methods: We used two statistical approaches to quantify migration lag. A direct approach compared frequency of large trees in the two latitudinal extremes and a modelling approach in which we first corrected data for the influence of temperature and then assessed the influence of latitude over the entire distribution of the tree species. Results: Contrary to our intuition that tree longevity would best explain the ability of trees to migrate, we found that seed mass was the only good descriptor of migration potential: trees with heavier seeds lag more. Conclusion: We interpret our results in terms of the well-established trade-off between seed mass and seed production in spermatophytes and discuss the possible functional implications that will result from selectively losing large-seeded trees. In summary, we provide an empirical study on how woody communities will respond to global warming over the next years.  2018, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",57,2

We tested how excavation (maintenance) of agricultural drains (ditches) altered fish assemblages. Uncertainty regarding the effects of drain maintenance on fish assemblages has been a source of tension between landowners, drain superintendents, and fishery managers. Fish assemblages in eight southwestern Ontario drains were sampled repeatedly from before to 2 years after drain maintenance using a replicated before-after, control-impact (BACI) design. Relative to reference sites, we found no evidence for short-or long-term decreases in the number of species and total abundance of fishes following drain maintenance, nor any consistent change in assemblage composition, despite clear changes in physical habitat. The fish assemblages in drains were resilient to drain maintenance and did not show changes expected to concern fishery managers. Our findings provide fishery managers with the information needed to manage drain maintenance more effectively under the Fish Protection Program of the Fisheries Act and to develop drain maintenance practices that balance the needs of agriculture with the protection of fish biodiversity.  2017 Canadian Science Publishing.

Seven variables characterizing physical habitat features important to fishes and three variables characterizing the taxonomic abundance, densities, and relative densities of benthic macroinvertebrates were measured before drain maintenance and 1012 times over 2 years following maintenance. Pulse responses were detected for three habitat variables quantifying vegetative cover: percent vegetation on the bank, percent in-stream vegetation, and percent cover. All three variables returned to pre-maintenance levels within two years of maintenance. No consistent changes were observed in the remaining habitat features or in the richness and densities of benthic invertebrate assemblages following drain maintenance. Our findings suggest that key features of fish habitat, structural properties and food availability, are resistant to drain maintenance.  2017 Elsevier Ltd",59,2

To determine the effect of MR area and age on biological responses, a RR analysis was performed on density and size data for both species from sites inside versus outside 13 MRs. Most MRs supported a greater density of larger individuals than unprotected areas. Linear and non-linear plots of MR age and area with respect to species-specific density and size were used to quantify the trajectories of the responses. In the RR meta-analysis but not in the Hedges' g meta-analysis, MR age explained significant variation in the density and size of both species, while no effect of MR area was detected in either analysis. Comparison of the performance of RR with that of Hedges' g revealed no overall evidence of a relationship between them, probably because the RR does not include an estimate of variance, whereas the Hedges' g analysis does. While RR analysis is an appropriate alternative to Hedges' g statistic meta-analysis assessments of MR effectiveness because of its ease of use and interpretation, we recommend that future RR analyses include both an estimate of variance and a test for `effect size'. Finally, we recommend that research be aimed at determining why different MRs produce different biological responses-that is, address why significant `effect size' exists.",60,1

How organic agriculture may contribute to world food production has been subject to vigorous debate over the past decade. Here, we revisit this topic comparing organic and conventional yields with a new meta-dataset three times larger than previously used (115 studies containing more than 1000 observations) and a new hierarchical analytical framework that can better account for the heterogeneity and structure in the data. We find organic yields are only 19.2\% (+/- 3.7\%) lower than conventional yields, a smaller yield gap than previous estimates. More importantly, we find entirely different effects of crop types and management practices on the yield gap compared with previous studies. For example, we found no significant differences in yields for leguminous versus non-leguminous crops, perennials versus annuals or developed versus developing countries. Instead, we found the novel result that two agricultural diversification practices, multi-cropping and crop rotations, substantially reduce the yield gap (to 9 +/- 4\% and 8 +/- 5\%, respectively) when the methods were applied in only organic systems. These promising results, based on robust analysis of a larger meta-dataset, suggest that appropriate investment in agroecological research to improve organic management systems could greatly reduce or eliminate the yield gap for some crops or regions.",61,1

Nonindependence can affect two major interrelated components of a meta-analysis: (i) the calculation of effect size statistics and (ii) the estimation of overall meta-analytic estimates and their uncertainty. While some solutions to nonindependence exist at the statistical analysis stages, there is little advice on what to do when complex analyses are not possible, or when studies with nonindependent experimental designs exist in the data. Here we argue that exploring the effects of procedural decisions in a meta-analysis (e.g. inclusion of different quality data, choice of effect size) and statistical assumptions (e.g. assuming no phylogenetic covariance) using sensitivity analyses are extremely important in assessing the impact of nonindependence. Sensitivity analyses can provide greater confidence in results and highlight important limitations of empirical work (e.g. impact of study design on overall effects). Despite their importance, sensitivity analyses are seldom applied to problems of nonindependence. To encourage better practice for dealing with nonindependence in meta-analytic studies, we present accessible examples demonstrating the impact that ignoring nonindependence can have on meta-analytic estimates. We also provide pragmatic solutions for dealing with nonindependent study designs, and for analysing dependent effect sizes. Additionally, we offer reporting guidelines that will facilitate disclosure of the sources of nonindependence in meta-analyses, leading to greater transparency and more robust conclusions.",63,1

Across taxa, host longevity, timing of maturity, and reproductive effort affect the organization of immune systems. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that these and related factors should also affect immune activation costs. Specifically, species that spread their breeding efforts over a long lifetime should experience lower immune costs than those that mature and breed quickly and die comparatively early. Likewise, body mass should affect immune costs, as body size affects the extent to which hosts are exposed to parasites as well as how hosts can combat infections (via its effects on metabolic rates and other factors). Here, we used phylogenetic meta-regression to reveal that, in general, animals incur costs of immune activation, but small species that are relatively long-lived incur the largest costs. These patterns probably arise because of the relative need for defense when infection risk is comparatively high and fitness can only be realized over a comparatively long period. However, given the diversity of species considered here and the overall modest effects of body mass and life history on immunecosts, much more research is necessary before generalizations are appropriate.",64,1

After enactment of the Local Government Code of 1991, the government actively promoted community-based fisheries management (CBFM) to conserve the coastal resources. The increased attention paid to community-based fisheries management has come about through experience of the poor performance of other approaches and through the study of traditional systems of community management of natural resources which have not only survived but also appear to perform better than the alternatives. This paper presents the results of a study to assess the impacts of CBFM projects in the Philippines, using meta-analysis, on the equity and sustainability of small-scale coastal fisheries. The outcomes indicate a positive impact of CBFM on the equity of both involvement in management and benefit sharing and sustainable management of fisheries resources through the investigation of effective magnitude (effect size) based on eight indicators. The positive summary effect sizes of participation, influence, control, access, and income conjunctly portrayed an improved equity in the fishing community by implementing CBFM. The positive summary effect sizes of compliance and conflict indicated an affirmative community and, therefore, sustainable fisheries management. While the negative summary effect size of resource revealed the difficulties in recovering fish abundance in a relatively short period of time. Also, ten years of implementation of CBFM was discovered as the minimum duration with perceived equity and sustainability improvement for most indicators.",65,2

In this work, we conducted a meta-analysis on REs (1539 data points) for a set of 209 chemicals consisting of fragrances, surfactants, and pharmaceuticals in order to assess the drivers of the variability relating to inherent properties of the chemicals and operational parameters of activated sludge WWTPs. For a reduced dataset (n = 542), we developed a mixed-effect model (meta-regression) to explore the observed variability in REs for the chemicals using three chemical specific factors and four WWTP-related parameters. The overall removal efficiency of the set of chemicals was 82.1\% (95\% CI 75.2-87.1\%, N = 1539). Our model accounted for 17\% of the total variability in REs, while the process-based model SimpleTreat did not perform better than the average of the measured REs. We identified that, after accounting for other factors potentially influencing RE, readily biodegradable compounds were better removed than non-readily biodegradable ones. Further, we showed that REs increased with increasing sludge retention times (SRTs), especially for non-readily biodegradable compounds. Finally, our model highlighted a decrease in RE with increasing K-OC. The counterintuitive relationship to K-OC stresses the need for a better understanding of electrochemical interactions influencing the RE of ionisable chemicals. In addition, we highlighted the need to improve the modelling of chemicals that undergo deconjugation when predicting RE. Our meta-analysis represents a first step in better explaining the observed variability in measured REs of chemicals. It can be of particular help to prioritize the improvements required in existing process-based models to predict removal efficiencies of chemicals in WWTPs. Environmental significance The amount of chemicals released into water bodies from consumer product use in developed countries mainly depends on the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove chemicals from wastewater. Current modelling approaches fail to explain the large variability observed in monitored removal efficiencies (REs). Applying a meta-analytical and meta-regression approach on a database of 1539 REs for surfactants, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals, we found empirical evidence that the sludge retention time of the WWTP, and biodegradation potential and partitioning to solids of the chemicals were important when modelling REs. Our model results also suggest that a better understanding of chemical-specific processes, like deconjugation and electrochemical interactions with sludge, are crucial for a better prediction of REs in WWTPs.",66,1

Therefore, it is important to investigate the impacts of drought on plant leaf CO2/H2O exchange and water use efficiency. This study assessed the responses of net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration (Tr), and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) to drought based on a worldwide meta-analysis of 112 published studies. The results demonstrated that drought decreased Pn, Tr, and Gs significantly and differently among different moderators. C-4 plants had smaller Pn reduction than C-3 plants, which gives C-4 plants an advantage in Pn. But their WUE decreased under drought conditions, indicating a great flexibility in C-4 WUE. Annual herbs sacrificed WUE (-6.2\%) to maintain efficient Pn. Perennial herbs took a different strategy in response to drought with an increased WUE (25.1\%). Deciduous tree species displayed a greater increase in WUE than conifers and evergreen species. Additionally, Gs had a significant correlation with Pn and Tr, but an insignificant correlation with WUE, which could be because WUE is affected by other factors (e.g., air flow, CO2 concentration, and relative humidity). These findings have significant implications for understanding the worldwide effects of drought on plant leaf CO2/H2O exchange and water use efficiency.",67,2

However, researchers still lack a comprehensive framework that can predict responses to climate change globally and across diverse taxa. Here, we synthesize hundreds of published time series of animal phenology from across the planet to show that temperature primarily drives phenological responses at mid-latitudes, with precipitation becoming important at lower latitudes, probably reflecting factors that drive seasonality in each region. Phylogeny and body size are associated with the strength of phenological shifts, suggesting emerging asynchronies between interacting species that differ in body size, such as hosts and parasites and predators and prey. Finally, although there are many compelling biological explanations for spring phenological delays, some examples of delays are associated with short annual records that are prone to sampling error.

However, their effectiveness varies from site to site and year to year depending on soil, cash and cover crop management, and climate. We conducted a meta-analysis using 238 observations from 28 studies (i) to assess the overall effect of cover crops on NO3- leaching and subsequent crop yields, and (ii) to examine how soil, cash and cover crop management, and climate impact the effect of non-leguminous cover crops on NO3- leaching. There is a clear indication that nonleguminous cover crops can substantially reduce NO3- leaching into freshwater systems, on average by 56\%. Nonlegume-legume cover crop mixtures reduced NO3- leaching as effectively as nonlegumes, but significantly more than legumes. The lack of variance information in most published literature prevents greater insight into the degree to which cover crops can improve water quality. Among the factors investigated, we identified cover crop planting dates, shoot biomass, and precipitation relative to long-term mean precipitation as potential drivers for the observed variability in nonleguminous cover crop effectiveness in reducing NO3- leaching. We found evidence indicating greater reduction in NO3- leaching with nonleguminous cover crops on coarse-textured soils and during years of low precipitation (<90\% of the long-term normal). Earlier fall planting and greater nonleguminous shoot biomass further reduced NO3- leaching. Overall, this meta-analysis confirms many prior studies showing that nonleguminous cover crops are an effective way to reduce NO3- leaching and should be integrated into cropping systems to improve water quality.",69,1
