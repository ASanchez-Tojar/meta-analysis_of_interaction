Ecological theory, individual experiments in many different systems, and system-specific quantitative reviews have suggested that (i) bottom-up control is pervasive but top-down control is more influential in aquatic habitats relative to terrestrial systems and (ii) bottom-up and top-down forces are interdependent, with statistical interactions that synergize or dampen relative influences on producer biomass. We used simple dynamic models to review ecological mechanisms that generate independent vs. interactive responses of community-level biomass. We calibrated these mechanistic predictions with the metrics of factorial meta-analysis and tested their prevalence across freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 191 factorial manipulations of herbivores and nutrients. Our analysis showed that producer community biomass increased with fertilization across all systems, although increases were greatest in freshwater habitats. Herbivore removal generally increased producer biomass in both freshwater and marine systems, but effects were inconsistent on land. With the exception of marine temperate rocky reef systems that showed positive synergism of nutrient enrichment and herbivore removal, experimental studies showed limited support for statistical interactions between nutrient and herbivory treatments on producer biomass. Top-down control of herbivores, compensatory behaviour of multiple herbivore guilds, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of interactions, and herbivore-mediated nutrient recycling may lower the probability of consistent interactive effects on producer biomass. Continuing studies should expand the temporal and spatial scales of experiments, particularly in understudied terrestrial systems; broaden factorial designs to manipulate independently multiple producer resources (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, light), multiple herbivore taxa or guilds (e.g. vertebrates and invertebrates) and multiple trophic levels; and - in addition to measuring producer biomass - assess the responses of species diversity, community composition and nutrient status.  2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",3,"lnRR1"

More specifically, this paper attempts to measure key variables of RFID adoption derived from Rogers' innovation theory and further examines how state intervention influences the process of RFD adoption. First, this paper compares, relying on a meta-analysis, various mean effect sizes among technological, organizational and environmental factors (i.e. government-driven policies) that Rogers suggested in his innovation model. Design/methodology/approach - In mean effect size analysis, this paper finds that the technological factor is the most powerful factor that affects the RFID adoption. The technological factor is statistically significant across all regions, including North America, Europe and Asia. The organizational factor is significant only in developing countries like Southeast Asian countries and East Asian countries. Environmental factors like government intervention for facilitating RFID adoption are strong enough only in Southeast Asia and Europe. Findings - This paper finds that government's supportive policy is more effective in Europe but not in America, while external pressure is still more effective in Southeast Asia. These results implicate that developmentalism or government-driven policy can be effective not only in developing countries but also in the case of developed countries. In addition, this paper conducts a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis based on Fisher's standardized score. Originality/value - In SUR analysis, this paper finds that the correlations between RFID adoption intention and three innovation factors vary across industrial areas. More specifically, the manufacturing area shows negative moderating effect on all three equations where correlations between Rogers' innovation factors and RFID adoption intention are meta-dependent variables. Also, RFD adoption is accelerated when the size of the firm is large or the location of the firm is in Southeast Asia. This result implicates that the aspect of technology adoption can be changed by region and type of industry."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR2"

Studies assessing the effects of extensive livestock grazing on vegetation and soils in SSA are inconsistent in the direction and magnitude of study outcomes. We applied meta-analysis to identify whether studies so far conducted in the rangeland systems of SSA have detected significant rangeland degradation as approximated by changes in vegetation attributes (reduction in species diversity and richness; decreased biomass and ground cover; increased woody species density and canopy cover) and soil properties (Decreased soil OC, N and P). We quantified results of the included studies using the response ratio, which is the log proportional change in the means of a treatment and a control group. Four moderator variables (elevation (<1500 and 1500m above sea level); plant life form (herbaceous and woody), rainfall amount (<600mm and 600mm), rainfall modality (mono and bimodal), and soil texture (Loam, sandy, sandy loam)) appeared to affect the response of species diversity and richness patterns to different grazing regimes, i.e., communal grazing systems, exclosures, livestock ranches and game reserves. Species diversity and richness values were generally lower in the communal grazing systems compared to the other grazing regimes. Only three moderator variables (rainfall amount and modality, and soil texture) affected the herbaceous basal cover response. Differences in soil OC were highest between communal and exclosure areas, visible at high elevations and under high rainfall. Soil N was influenced by rainfall modality and soil texture. We conclude that the effects of grazing regimes onto the environment cannot be generalized but are specific across vegetation and soil variables and differ considerably with rainfall and elevation.  2015 Elsevier Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR3"

Amphibian population losses have been more severe than those of birds and mammals. Amphibian population declines are likely due to many factors including habitat loss, disease, contaminants, introduced species and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. The effect of UVB, however, varies widely among species and can vary within populations of the same species or at different life-history stages. This variation has often led to opposing conclusions about how UVB affects amphibians. We used meta-analysis techniques to explore the overall effects of UVB radiation on survival in amphibians. We also used recently developed factorial meta-analytic techniques to quantify potential interactions between UVB radiation and other stressors on amphibians. Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by 1.9-fold compared with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible to damage from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental stressors and resulted in greater than additive effects on survival when 2 stressors were present. Our results suggest that UVB radiation is an important stressor in amphibians, particularly in light of potential synergisms between UVB and other stressors in amphibian habitats.  2008 Society for Conservation Biology."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR4"

They are keystone structures that may play important roles in maintaining ecosystem functions, services, and farmland biodiversity. However, scattered trees in agricultural landscapes are declining worldwide due to intensive land use. They are often perceived by farmers as having negative impacts on agricultural production. Large-scale assessments in different biomes of agricultural yield in scattered tree ecosystems remain rare. Filling this knowledge gap may help improve decision-making regarding the value of scattered trees in agricultural landscapes. Using meta-analysis, we found that, across four tree functional groups (deciduous, Eucalyptus, N-2-fixing, evergreen oak), mature scattered trees do not compromise pasture yield. The sign and magnitude of scattered tree effects on pasture yield did vary, however, among tree functional groups and according to precipitation levels. Our study suggests that, as drought pressure increases abiotic stress, tree facilitation by N-2-fixing trees, and competition by Eucalyptus, will become the more common interactions between scattered trees and pasture. Management options exist to conserve and restore scattered trees in agricultural landscapes, but new policies are required to support their widespread adoption by farmers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the advance of ecology requires making generalizations that synthesize current knowledge and guide new basic research and practical applications. Among the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis is one of the most accurate and powerful methods. This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant ecology from populations to ecosystems. The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of meta-analyses. The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g. landscape fragmentation). Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and informing the scope of generalizations. However, plant ecologists can only take full advantage of this capacity if we improve our knowledge on how and when to conduct a proper meta-analysis, and by avoiding the frequent misuses that have characterized the use of this statistical tool in the ecological literature thus far.  2014 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR6"

Cumulative meta-analyses revealed dramatic temporal changes in the magnitude and direction of the plant and herbivore responses reported during the last two decades. Studies conducted in the 1980s reported increase in phenolic concentrations, reduction in nutrient concentrations and negative effect on herbivore performance, consistently with the idea of induced resistance. In contrast, in the early 1990s when the idea that some types of plant damage may result in induced susceptibility was generally accepted, studies reported non-significant results or induced susceptibility, and smaller effects on herbivores. The above changes may reflect paradigm shifts in the theory of induced defenses and/or the differences between study systems used in the early and the more recent studies. Overall, plant growth and carbohydrate concentrations were reduced in damaged plants despite enhanced photosynthetic rates. Damage increased the concentrations of carbon and phenolics, while terpene concentrations tended to decrease after damage; changes in nutrient concentrations after damage varied according to nutrient mobility, inherent plant growth rate, ontogenetic stage and plant type (deciduous/evergreen). Early season damage caused more pronounced changes in plants than late season damage, which is in accordance with the assumption that vigorously growing foliage has a greater capacity to respond to damage. Insect growth rate and female pupal weight decreased on previously damaged plants, while herbivore survival, consumption and male pupal weight were not significantly affected. The magnitude and direction of herbivore responses depended on the type of plant, the type of damage, the time interval between the damage and insect feeding (rapid/delayed induced resistance), and the timing of the damage."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR7"

Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant-enemy and plant-mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of (negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse (but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non-crop plants (suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication).

Overall, herbivory reduced mycorrhizal colonization by about 3 percentage points. Treatment, host plant type and year of publication were the only significant moderators, with real or simulated herbivory of leaves and real herbivory of shoots suppressing colonization, while simulated removal of shoots tended to increase colonization.

Mycorrhizal colonization of annual crops was reduced by about 12 percentage points, although this was not significantly different from zero. Mycorrhizal colonization of perennial forbs and evergreen trees was also unaffected by herbivory, and colonization of mixtures of perennial grasses and forbs increased by about 15 percentage points following herbivory. Effect size increased with year of publication, likely due to shifts in experimental designs towards systems more likely to show positive effects of herbivory on mycorrhiza.4. Synthesis.

Many studies have attempted to document plant response to warming by grouping species into functional groups. Within functional groups, however, species often display divergent responses. Determining how foliar functional traits might be used to predict plant responses to warming could reduce analytical complexity while maintaining generalizations across systems. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis on 18 studies (consisting of 38 species) of plant biomass response to experimental or natural warming. We determined whether plant trait estimates associated with the leaf economics spectrum [leaf life span (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (Nmass), leaf phosphorus (Pmass), photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and stomatal conductance (Gs)] from a global plant database of experimentally unmanipulated plants, GloPNet, could be used to predict biomass response to experimental warming. Results: We found that three single leaf traits (LL, Nmass and Amax) were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming treatments, perhaps due to their association with plant growth rates, adaptation rate and ability, each explaining between 21-46% of the variation in plant biomass responses. The magnitude of response to warming decreased with increasing LL, but increased with increasing Nmass and Amax. We found no linear combination of any of these traits that predicted warming response. Conclusions: These results show that foliar traits can aid in understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to temperature across species. Because each trait only explained a portion of variation in how plant growth responded to warming, however, future studies that examine how plant communities respond to warming should simultaneously measure multiple leaf traits, especially those most sensitive to warming, across plant species, to determine whether the predictive ability of functional traits changes between different ecosystems or plant taxonomic groups. Using a meta-analysis of plant biomass response to warming, and a global plant database, we found that leaf traits LL, Nmass, and Amax were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming treatments, each explaining between 21-46% of the variation in plant biomass responses.

We performed a meta-analysis of 434 studies spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in responses of plant-fungal symbioses to future environments. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change? (2) Do fungal symbiont groups differ in the degree to which they modify plant response to global change? (3) Do particular global change factors affect plant-fungal symbioses more than others? In all global change scenarios, except elevated CO2, fungal symbionts significantly altered plant responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of multiple fungal symbioses.

Whereas the mean prey biomass is generally reduced by consumer presence, the effect on spatial heterogeneity is less clear-cut. A meta-analysis of almost 600 field experiments manipulating the presence of benthic invertebrate or vertebrate grazers was conducted to analyze the effect of grazers on both the absolute spatial variability of periphyton biomass and the relative variability, which was standardized to the mean. Effects on absolute variability were measured as the log response ratio of the standard deviation of biomass (LR-SD), whereas effects on relative variability were measured as the log response ratio of the coefficient of variation of biomass (LR-CV). The overall magnitude and range of LR-SD and LR-CV indicated that grazers not only reduced periphyton biomass, but also substantially altered their spatial distribution. However, grazer effects differed strongly for absolute and relative variability. On average, grazers reduced the absolute spatial variability in prey biomass by 50% (average LRSD = -0.68) but increased the relative variability by 24% (average LR-CV = 0.22). The magnitude of LR-SD strongly depended on the efficiency of grazing, with strong biomass removal leading to strong homogenization. Moreover, LR-CV and LR-SD were significantly affected by habitat type (freshwater vs. coastal) and substrata.

Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding of the factors that control consumer regulation of vascular plants in aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plantherbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes in plant abundance would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes in plant abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions in plant abundance than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions in plant abundance than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions in plant abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change in plant abundance, with the strongest reductions in plant abundance reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions in plant abundance. Finally, we found that herbivoreplant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions in plant abundance compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions in plant abundance compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivoreplant nativeness on changes in plant abundance were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions in aquatic plant abundance are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plantherbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants.  2016 The Authors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR13"

Although the evidence of greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus, tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall, phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients, light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile task because different traits favor invasiveness in different environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global macro-analyses."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",4,"lnRR14"

We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 85 experimental studies reporting the effects of root-feeding insect herbivores (36 species) on plants (75 species). On average, belowground herbivory led to a 36.3% loss of root biomass, which was accompanied by a reduction in aboveground growth (-16.3%), photosynthesis (-11.7%) and reproduction (-15.5%). The effects of root herbivory on aboveground plant characteristics were significant in agricultural and biological control studies, but not in studies of natural systems. Experiments conducted in controlled environments yielded larger effects on plants than field experiments, and infestation experiments resulted in more severe effects than removal studies employing natural levels of herbivory. Simulated root herbivory led to greater aboveground growth reductions than similar root loss imposed by insect feeding. External root chewers caused stronger detrimental effects than sap feeders or root borers; specialist herbivores imposed milder adverse effects on plants than generalists. Woody plants suffered from root herbivory more than herbaceous plants, although root loss was similar in these two groups. Evergreen woody plants responded to root herbivory more strongly than deciduous woody plants, and grasses suffered from root herbivory more than herbs. Environmental factors such as drought, poor nutrient supply, among-plant competition, and aboveground herbivory increased the adverse effects of root damage on plants in an additive manner. In general, plant tolerance to root herbivores is lower than tolerance to defoliating aboveground herbivores.  2011 Springer-Verlag."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",3,"lnRR17"

Similar to many arid and semi-arid grasslands throughout the world, California grasslands have a history of invasion by non-native grasses and forbs. Attempts to restore native plant populations using managed grazing are common, despite the lack of an overarching quantitative basis for assessing livestock effects on different plant groups. Given the wide range of soils, climate and topography over which grasslands are found, it is important to understand the context-dependency of grazing effects across a region. We performed a meta-analysis of livestock grazing within California grasslands to investigate the response of different plant groups to grazing relative to precipitation, grassland type, soil and grazing regime. We found that exotic forbs showed a dramatic, uniform increase in cover with grazing, but no increase in richness. By contrast, native forbs increased in richness yet their cover response was weak and variable depending on grazing regime and precipitation. Exotic grass cover was unaffected while richness was enhanced by grazing. Native grass cover generally increased with grazing, although the high variation among studies was not predicted by the explanatory variables we evaluated. These results lend support to the use of grazing to enhance native forb richness and native grass cover in some settings although this must be weighed against increases in the cover of exotic forbs.  2012 Elsevier Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR19"

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. In evaluating AMF as significant predictors of mycorrhizal ecology, precise quantifiable changes in plant biomass and nutrient uptake under salt stress are crucial factors. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to analyze the magnitude of the effects of AMF inoculation on growth and nutrient uptake of plants under salt stress through meta-analyses. For this, data were compared in the context of mycorrhizal host plant species, plant family and functional group, herbaceous vs. woody plants, annual vs. perennial plants, and the level of salinity across 43 studies. Results indicate that, under saline conditions, AMF inoculation significantly increased total, shoot, and root biomass as well as phosphorous (P), nitrogen (N), and potassium (K) uptake. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase also increased significantly in mycorrhizal compared to nonmycorrhizal plants growing under salt stress. In addition, sodium (Na) uptake decreased significantly in mycorrhizal plants, while changes in proline accumulation were not significant. Across most subsets of the data analysis, identities of AMF (Glomus fasciculatum) and host plants (Acacia nilotica, herbs, woody and perennial) were found to be essential in understanding plant responses to salinity stress. For the analyzed dataset, it is concluded that under salt stress, mycorrhizal plants have extensive root traits and mycorrhizal morphological traits which help the uptake of more P and K, together with the enhanced production of antioxidant enzymes resulting in salt stress alleviation and increased plant biomass.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",3,"lnRR20"

Meta-analysis was used to quantitatively assess invasive plant performance and release from enemy damage and how these change with residence time and geographic distribution. Invasive plants were compared either in their introduced and home ranges or with native congeners in the introduced range. Invasive plants in the introduced range were generally larger, allocated more to reproduction, and had lower levels of herbivore damage compared with conspecifics in the home range; pathogen attack, however, varied widely. In congener comparisons, invasive and native plants did not differ in size or herbivory, but invaders did allocate less to reproduction and had lower levels of pathogen damage. Time since introduction was a significant nonlinear predictor of enemy release for both herbivores and pathogens, with initial release in recently arrived species and little to no release after 50 to 200 years. Geographic distribution was also a significant nonlinear predictor of enemy release.

Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments.  2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR23"

For mosquitoes, most such experiments have focused on invasive Aedes albopictus and its interactions with resident Aedes. A meta-analysis of such experiments tested whether the effect of interspecific competition is greater than, less than, or equal to that of intraspecific competition, and whether competitive outcomes are dependent on food quality. For A. albopictus and A. aegypti, there was significant context dependence, with interspecific competitive advantage for A. albopictus with low food quality, and competitive equivalence with high food quality. Meta-analysis of survivorship yielded more significant effects than did estimated rate of increase. Competitive effects and competitive responses of each species yielded similar results. This meta-analysis suggests competitive exclusion of A. aegypti by A. albopictus, and is thus consistent with field sampling, qualitative reviews, and interpretations from individual publications. For A. albopictus and A. triseriatus, most results indicated competitive equivalence and no context dependence, and are thus contrary to previous qualitative reviews and to interpretations from individual publications. For both pairs of species, published results suitable for meta-analysis remain scarce, and better experimental designs and improved analysis and reporting of statistical results are needed. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on estimating species' inter- and intraspecific competitive effects, rather than the more common, but theoretically less interesting, competitive responses.

These may affect each other directly and indirectly, enhancing or reducing the amount of plant resources they each consume. Ultimately, this may reduce or enhance plant performance relative to what should be expected from the added impacts of herbivore and pathogen when they attack alone. Previous studies have suggested synergistic and antagonistic impacts on plant performance from certain combinations of arthropods and pathogens, for example, synergistic impacts from necrotrophic pathogens together with wounding arthropods because of facilitated infection and antagonistic impacts from induction of pathogen resistance by sucking herbivores. We compiled published studies on the impact of plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions on plant performance and used meta-analysis to search for consistent patterns of impacts among plant, herbivore and pathogen characteristics and experimental conditions, and to test the suggested hypotheses on synergistic or antagonistic impacts. None of the hypotheses based on proximate interactions between arthropods and pathogens were supported by our analysis; in contrast, the patterns we found were related to plant traits and experimental conditions. Our results suggest that immediate loss of resources from interactions between arthropod herbivores and pathogens is generally moderated by compensation to an extent where there are no interactive effects on plant performance. However, as interactive impacts also differed among environments and parasite manipulation methods, this suggests that the ability of plants to compensate such losses may depend on environmental conditions and probably also overall infection load.  2013 The Authors.

Animal-pollinated flowers need to attract pollinators but also to avoid conflicts with antagonistic consumers. The view of flower visitors as mutualistic and antagonistic agents considers primarily the plants' interest. A classification emphasizing the consumer's point of view, however, may be more useful when considering animal's adaptations to flower visits which may include a tolerance against defensive floral scent compounds. MethodsIn a meta-analysis covering 18 studies on the responses of animals to floral scents, the animals were assigned to the categories of obligate and facultative flower visitors which considers their dependency on floral resources. Their responses on floral scents were compared. Key ResultsOn average, obligate flower visitors, often corresponding to pollinators, were attracted to floral scent compounds. In contrast, facultative and mainly antagonistic visitors were strongly repelled by floral scents. The findings confirm that floral scents have a dual function both as attractive and defensive cues. ConclusionsWhether an animal depends on floral resources determines its response to these signals, suggesting that obligate flower visitors evolved a tolerance against primarily defensive compounds. Therefore, floral scent bouquets in conjunction with nutritious rewards may solve the conflicting tasks of attracting mutualists while repelling antagonists.  The Author 2010.

However, in gynodioecious species, some members of the population are male-sterile and reproduce only by setting seed, while others gain fitness through both male and female function. How females compensate for the loss of male function remains unresolved for most gynodioecious species. Here, as with many plants, fitness differences may be influenced by interactions with multiple species. However, whether multiple species interactions result in gender-specific fitness differences remains unknown. Using observational data from 2009-2010, we quantified seed set of the two sex morphs of Polemonium foliosissimum and asked how it is affected by pollination, and seed predation from a dipteran predispersal seed predator (Anthomyiidae: Hylemya sp.). We assessed seed production and losses to predation in 27 populations for one year and in six populations for a second year. Females set significantly more seed than did hermaphrodites in both years. Of the fitness components we assessed, including the number of flowers per plant, fruit set, seeds/fruit, and proportion of fruits destroyed by Hylemya, only fruit destruction differed significantly between the sexes. In one year, seeds/fruit and predation had a stronger effect on seed set for hermaphrodites than for females. Because predispersal seed predators do not pollinate flowers, their effects may depend on successful pollination of flowers on which they oviposit. To examine if genders differed in pollen limitation and seed predation and/or their interactive effects, in 2011 we hand-pollinated flowers and removed seed predator eggs in a fully factorial design. Both sexes were pollen limited, but their degree of pollen limitation did not differ. However, predation reduced seed set more for hermaphrodites than for females. We found no significant interaction between hand pollen and seed predation, and no interaction between hand pollination and gender. Our results suggest that while interactions with both pollinators and seed predators affect reproductive success, floral enemies can cause inequality in seed set between genders. The next step is to understand how the seed set advantage affects long-term fitness and persistence of females in gynodioecious populations.  2015 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR29"

Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles.

Meta-analysis has become the standard for quantitative evidence synthesis in many disciplines, offering a broadly accepted and statistically powerful framework for estimating the magnitude, consistency, and homogeneity of the effect of interest across studies. Here, we review previous and current uses of meta-analysis in plant pathology with a focus on applications in epidemiology and disease management. About a dozen formal meta-analyses have been published in the plant pathological literature in the past decade, and several more are currently in progress. Three broad research questions have been addressed, the most common being the comparative efficacy of chemical treatments for managing disease and reducing yield loss across environments. The second most common application has been the quantification of relationships between disease intensity and yield, or between different measures of disease, across studies. Lastly, metaanalysis has been applied to assess factors affecting pathogen-biocontrol agent interactions or the effectiveness of biological control of plant disease or weeds. In recent years, fixed-effects meta-analysis has been largely replaced by random-(or mixed-) effects analysis owing to the statistical benefits associated with the latter and the wider availability of computer software to conduct these analyses. Another recent trend has been the more common use of multivariate meta-analysis or meta-regression to analyze the impacts of study-level independent variables (moderator variables) on the response of interest. The application of meta-analysis to practical problems in epidemiology and disease management is illustrated with case studies from our work on Phakopsora pachyrhizi on soybean and Erwinia amylovora on apple. We show that although meta-analyses are often used to corroborate and validate general conclusions drawn from more traditional, qualitative reviews, they can also reveal new patterns and interpretations not obvious from individual studies.  2011 The American Phytopathological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR32"

Here we use a meta-analysis of 215 studies with 1526 experiments that measured plant growth responses to additions or removals of soil organisms to test how different soil trophic levels affect plant growth. Consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis, we found that herbivores and plant pathogens (henceforth pests) decreased plant growth and that predators of pests increased plant growth. The magnitude of this trophic cascade was similar to that reported for aboveground systems. In contrast, we did not find evidence for trophic cascades in decomposer- and symbiont-based (henceforth mutualist) food chains. In these food chains, mutualists increased plant growth and predators of mutualists also increased plant growth, presumably by increasing nutrient cycling rates. Therefore, mutualists, predators of mutualists and predators of pests all increased plant growth. Further, experiments that added multiple organisms from different trophic levels also increased plant growth. As a result, across the dataset, soil organisms increased plant growth 29\% and non-pest soil organisms increased plant growth 46\%. Omnivory has traditionally been thought to confound soil trophic dynamics, but here we suggest that omnivory allows for a simplified perspective of soil food webs - one in which most soil organisms increase plant growth by preying on pests or increasing nutrient cycling rates. An implication of this perspective is that processes that decrease soil organism abundance (e.g. soil tillage) are likely to decrease aboveground productivity. <boxed-text content-type={''}all{''"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",3,"lnRR33"

We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context-dependent effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth, reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater than 0. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however. Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extrafloral nectar, food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory were greater in tropical vs. temperate systems. Although ant-plant interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta-analyses, indicate that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic interactions.

There were significant differences in the overall effects of root, shoot and full competition. Root competition generally resulted in larger biomass reduction than shoot competition, particularly among the smaller of the two competitors. An interaction between root and shoot competition was observed in some experiments but was generally not significant. While root competition was generally stronger than shoot competition at lower nutrient levels, there was no overall difference at higher nutrient levels due to much lower levels of root competition. In contrast, the overall effect of full competition increased considerably with nutrient level. Root competition was generally more important when the neighbour was a grass as compared with a herb or a legume, and when domesticated plants competed with wild neighbours, suggesting that wild genotypes are stronger competitors for below-ground resources than are crop plants. Effects of competition were generally stronger in experiments with additive designs than in those with substitutive designs. Also, experiments using single target individuals showed stronger effects of competition, root competition in particular, than did experiments using groups targets. Synthesis. Despite large variation among experiments, some general patterns were supported: effects of root competition are generally stronger than shoot competition, particularly (i) for smaller competitors, (ii) at low fertility levels, (iii) when the competitor is a grass rather than an herb, (iv) when the competitor is a wild rather than a domesticated species, and (v) in additive design experiments. The effects of root and shoot competition appear to be additive under many conditions. Whereas root competition may often be the primary limitation on mean plant performance, shoot competition will influence the variation around this mean and may determine which individuals or species dominate.  2013 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR37"

Studies with several model organisms have shown that these substances can exert diverse behavioural and physiological effects on females, including altered longevity and reproductive output, yet a comprehensive synthesis across taxa is lacking. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize quantitatively extensive experimental work examining how male ejaculate quantity affects different components of female fitness. We summarize effect sizes for female fecundity (partial and lifetime) and longevity from 84 studies conducted on 70 arthropod species that yielded a total of 130 comparisons of female fecundity and 61 comparisons of female longevity. In response to greater amounts of ejaculate, arthropod females demonstrate enhanced fecundity (both partial and lifetime) but reduced longevity, particularly for Diptera and Lepidoptera. Across taxa, multiply mated females show particularly large fecundity increases compared to singly mated females, indicating that single matings do not maximize female fitness. This fecundity increase is balanced by a slight negative effect on lifespan, with females that received more ejaculate through polyandrous matings showing greater reductions in lifespan compared with females that have mated repeatedly with the same male. We found no significant effect size differences for either female fecundity or longevity between taxa that transfer sperm packaged into spermatophores compared to taxa that transfer ejaculates containing free sperm. Furthermore, females that received relatively larger or more spermatophores demonstrated greater lifetime fecundity, indicating that these seminal nuptial gifts provide females with a net fitness benefit. These results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary origin and maintenance of non-sperm ejaculate components, and provide insight into female mate choice and optimal mating patterns.  2010 The Authors.

Traditionally, techniques of plant manipulation during restoration have focused on the reduction of competition by 'problematic' existing vegetation. However, the increasing recognition of facilitation as a main process regulating the composition of communities has brought a change in the practice of restoration towards a better awareness of the benefits inherent to conserving neighbouring vegetation. 2. Here, I provide the results of a meta-analysis of published studies that have manipulated interactions among plants with the objective of restoring degraded terrestrial systems. I created four different data sets corresponding to the variables most commonly used to measure plant performance (i.e. emergence, survival, growth and density), and asked whether the benefits of facilitation as a restoration tool vary depending on the study duration, the life-form of the neighbour and target species, and the ecosystem type. 3. Neighbour effects varied strongly among performance estimators. Positive effects were frequently found for emergence and survival, whereas neutral or negative interactions predominated for growth and density. 4. No clear support existed for a relationship between study duration and neighbour effect. 5. The life-form of the interacting species, particularly of neighbours, largely influenced the interaction outcome. Herbs had strong negative effects, especially on other herb species, whereas shrubs had large facilitative effects, especially on trees. 6. Semiarid and tropical systems showed in general more positive neighbour effects than wetlands and particularly mesic temperate systems, where negative interactions predominated. However, these results were largely influenced by the over-representation of herb species in wetlands and temperate habitats, survival facilitation being found in all systems when only woody species were considered. 7. Synthesis. Pre-existing vegetation can have large impacts on species establishment in degraded habitats. Inhibition predominates in herbaceous communities typical of early-successional stages, whereas facilitation prevailes in communities dominated by shrubs and trees. Even productive systems (e.g. mesic temperate habitats) appear suitable for the application of facilitation as a restoration tool of woody communities. Whereas restoring herbaceous communities seems largely reliable on removal techniques, augmenting populations of nurse shrubs and trees should be considered a promising strategy for restoring woody late-successional communities.  2009 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR39"

Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (15%) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability.

Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35%, and reduced overall activity by 72%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions.

Subsequently, this affects the covariance, reliability, and validity of assessment procedures negatively. The model predicts that a mean ratio (faking ratio) greater than 1 and a coefficient of homogeneity u smaller than 1 characterizes faking. Meta-analysis was used to test several predictions of the theoretical model in the case of the personality measures. A database of 46 independent studies was created.

The concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, which is inspired by the Fry paradigm of a bell-shaped increase-optimum-decrease-type response of aerobic scope to increasing temperature, but also includes proposed negative and synergistic effects of elevated CO2 levels, has been suggested as a unifying framework. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to assess the following: (i) the generality of a bell-shaped relationship between absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and temperature; (ii) to what extent elevated CO2 affects resting oxygen uptake MO2rest and AAS; and (iii) whether there is an interaction between elevated temperature and CO2. The behavioural effects of CO2 are also briefly discussed. In 31 out of 73 data sets (both acutely exposed and acclimated), AAS increased and remained above 90% of the maximum, whereas a clear thermal optimum was observed in the remaining 42 data sets. Carbon dioxide caused a significant rise in MO2rest in only 18 out of 125 data sets, and a decrease in 25, whereas it caused a decrease in AAS in four out of 18 data sets and an increase in two. The analysis did not reveal clear evidence for an overall correlation with temperature, CO2 regime or duration of CO2 treatment. When CO2 had an effect, additive rather than synergistic interactions with temperature were most common and, interestingly, they even interacted antagonistically on MO2rest and AAS. The behavioural effects of CO2 could complicate experimental determination of respiratory performance. Overall, this meta-analysis reveals heterogeneity in the responses to elevated temperature and CO2 that is not in accordance with the idea of a single unifying principle and which cannot be ignored in attempts to model and predict the impacts of global warming and ocean acidification on marine ectotherms.

It is important to understand how bivalve aquaculture interacts with eelgrass to support the sustainable development of this globally expanding industry. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the positive and negative effects of bivalve aquaculture on eelgrass by conducting the first quantitative, global meta-analysis of aquaculture-eelgrass studies. A literature review resulted in 125 studies that met established criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The meta-analysis determined: (1) how eelgrass responds to on-bottom and off-bottom bivalve aquaculture, (2) how these responses vary between regions and specific grow-out methods, and (3) the resilience of eelgrass after harvesting disturbances. On-bottom culture (laying directly on the sediment potentially including predator exclusion devices) corresponded to significant increases in eelgrass growth and reproduction, and a decrease in density and biomass. Off-bottom culture (e.g., longline and suspended bag) resulted in significant decreases in eelgrass density, percent cover, and reproduction. Results support a space-competition hypothesis for on-bottom culture and provide limited support for light limitation in off-bottom culture, although other mechanisms of interaction are potentially occurring as well. A US west coast case study revealed regional differences in eelgrass responses, including a more negative trend in eelgrass density from off-bottom culture, and a neutral effect on reproduction from on-bottom culture (relative to neutral and positive trend, respectively, in the average of all other studies). Eelgrass densities recovered after all harvest methods, however mechanical harvest methods created greater initial impact and longer recovery times than manual harvest methods. The time-period over which observations were reported was an important variable that was not included in the analysis but could influence these results. These analyses suggest the response of eelgrass to bivalve aquaculture varies depending on eelgrass characteristics, grow-out approaches, and harvesting methods, with potential regionally specific relationships. Questions remain, regarding how this dynamic relationship between eelgrass and aquaculture habitat relates to ecological functions and services in the nearshore environment.  2018"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR46"

Across taxa, host longevity, timing of maturity, and reproductive effort affect the organization of immune systems. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that these and related factors should also affect immune activation costs. Specifically, species that spread their breeding efforts over a long lifetime should experience lower immune costs than those that mature and breed quickly and die comparatively early. Likewise, body mass should affect immune costs, as body size affects the extent to which hosts are exposed to parasites as well as how hosts can combat infections (via its effects on metabolic rates and other factors). Here, we used phylogenetic meta-regression to reveal that, in general, animals incur costs of immune activation, but small species that are relatively long-lived incur the largest costs. These patterns probably arise because of the relative need for defense when infection risk is comparatively high and fitness can only be realized over a comparatively long period.

We conducted a meta-analysis using 238 observations from 28 studies (i) to assess the overall effect of cover crops on NO3- leaching and subsequent crop yields, and (ii) to examine how soil, cash and cover crop management, and climate impact the effect of non-leguminous cover crops on NO3- leaching. There is a clear indication that nonleguminous cover crops can substantially reduce NO3- leaching into freshwater systems, on average by 56\%. Nonlegume-legume cover crop mixtures reduced NO3- leaching as effectively as nonlegumes, but significantly more than legumes. The lack of variance information in most published literature prevents greater insight into the degree to which cover crops can improve water quality. Among the factors investigated, we identified cover crop planting dates, shoot biomass, and precipitation relative to long-term mean precipitation as potential drivers for the observed variability in nonleguminous cover crop effectiveness in reducing NO3- leaching. We found evidence indicating greater reduction in NO3- leaching with nonleguminous cover crops on coarse-textured soils and during years of low precipitation (<90\% of the long-term normal). Earlier fall planting and greater nonleguminous shoot biomass further reduced NO3- leaching. Overall, this meta-analysis confirms many prior studies showing that nonleguminous cover crops are an effective way to reduce NO3- leaching and should be integrated into cropping systems to improve water quality."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR49"

There is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in invaded CVHs amounting to 40% (16%) higher C storage than uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders. Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal systems.

Thus, farming systems that are both highly productive and minimize environmental harms are critically needed. Howorganic agriculture may contribute to world food production has been subject to vigorous debate over the past decade. Here, we revisit this topic comparing organic and conventional yields with a new meta-dataset three times larger than previously used (115 studies containing more than 1000 observations) and a new hierarchical analytical framework that can better account for the heterogeneity and structure in the data. We find organic yields are only 19.2% (3.7%) lower than conventional yields, a smaller yield gap than previous estimates. More importantly, we find entirely different effects of crop types and management practices on the yield gap compared with previous studies. For example, we found no significant differences in yields for leguminous versus non-leguminous crops, perennials versus annuals or developed versus developing countries. Instead, we found the novel result that two agricultural diversification practices, multi-cropping and crop rotations, substantially reduce the yield gap (to 94% and 85%, respectively) when the methods were applied in only organic systems. These promising results, based on robust analysis of a larger meta-dataset, suggest that appropriate investment in agroecological research to improve organic management systems could greatly reduce or eliminate the yield gap for some crops or regions.  2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Vegetation models incorporating this interaction predict that the response of net primary productivity (NPP) to elevated CO2 (eCa) will increase with rising temperature and will be substantially larger in warm tropical forests than in cold boreal forests. We tested these model predictions against evidence from eCa experiments by carrying out two meta-analyses. Firstly, we tested for an interaction effect on growth responses in factorial eCa  temperature experiments. This analysis showed a positive, but nonsignificant interaction effect (95% CI for above-ground biomass response = -0.8, 18.0%) between eCa and temperature. Secondly, we tested field-based eCa experiments on woody plants across the globe for a relationship between the eCa effect on plant biomass and mean annual temperature (MAT). This second analysis showed a positive but nonsignificant correlation between the eCa response and MAT. The magnitude of the interactions between CO2 and temperature found in both meta-analyses were consistent with model predictions, even though both analyses gave nonsignificant results. Thus, we conclude that it is not possible to distinguish between the competing hypotheses of no interaction vs. an interaction based on Rubisco kinetics from the available experimental database.

Incorporation of crop residues (CR) may be a sustainable management practice to maintain the SOC levels and to increase soil fertility. This study quantifies the effects of CR incorporation on SOC and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O) in Europe using data from long-term experiments. Response ratios (RRs) for SOC and GHG emissions were calculated between CR incorporation and removal. The influence of environmental zones (ENZs), clay content and experiment duration on the RRs was investigated. We also studied how RRs of SOC and crop yields were correlated. A total of 475 RRs were derived from 39 publications. The SOC increased by 7% following CR incorporation. In contrast, in a subsample of cases, CO2 emissions were six times and N2O emissions 12 times higher following CR incorporation. The ENZ had no significant influence on RRs. For SOC concentration, soils with a clay content &gt;35% showed 8% higher RRs compared with soils with clay contents between 18 and 35%. As the experiment progressed, RR for SOC concentration increased. For N2O emissions, RR was significantly greater in experiments with a duration &lt;5 yr compared with 11-20 yr. No significant correlations were found between RR for SOC concentration and yields, but differences between sites and study durations were detected.

Despite a wealth of research on how animals respond to anthropogenic changes to natural wetlands and how they use created wetlands, we lack a broad synthesis of these data. While some altered wetlands may provide vital habitat, others could pose a considerable risk to wildlife. This risk will be heightened if such wetlands are ecological trapspreferred habitats that confer lower fitness than another available habitat. Wetlands functioning as ecological traps could decrease both local and regional population persistence, and ultimately lead to extinctions. Most studies have examined how animals respond to changes in environmental conditions by measuring responses at the community and population levels, but studying ecological traps requires information on fitness and habitat preferences. Our current lack of knowledge of individual-level responses may therefore limit our capacity to manage wetland ecosystems effectively since ecological traps require different management practices to mitigate potential consequences. We conducted a global meta-analysis to characterise how animals respond to four key drivers of wetland alteration: agriculture, mining, restoration and urbanisation. Our overarching goal was to evaluate the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems, as well as identify current knowledge gaps that limit both the current understanding of these responses and effective wetland management. We extracted 1799 taxon-specific response ratios from 271 studies across 29 countries. Community- (e.g. richness) and population-level (e.g. density) measures within altered wetlands were largely comparable to those within reference wetlands. By contrast, individual fitness measures (e.g. survival) were often lower, highlighting the potential limitations of using only community- and population-level measures to assess habitat quality. Only four studies provided habitat-preference data, preventing investigation of the potential for altered wetlands to function as ecological traps. This is concerning because attempts to identify ecological traps may detect previously unidentified conservation risks. Although there was considerable variability amongst taxa, amphibians were typically the most sensitive taxon, and thus, may be a valuable bio-indicator of wetland quality. Despite suffering reduced survival and reproduction, measures such as time to and mass at metamorphosis were similar between altered and reference wetlands, suggesting that quantifying metamorphosis-related measures in isolation may not provide accurate information on habitat quality. Our review provides the most detailed evaluation to date of the ecological impacts of human alterations to wetland ecosystems. We emphasise that the role of wetlands in human-altered ecosystems can be complex, as they may represent important habitat but also pose potential risks to animals. Reduced availability of natural wetlands is increasing the importance of altered wetlands for aquatic animals. Consequently, we need to define what represents habitat quality from the perspective of animals, and gain a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of habitat selection and how these factors could be manipulated. Furthermore, strategies to enhance the quality of these wetlands should be implemented to maximise their conservation potential.  2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR55"

Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system-those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others-is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history, habitat use, and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities, whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure. Affiliation with ephemeral aquatic habitat and breadth of habitat use were strong predictors of vulnerability to and intensity of infection and several other traits including body size, lifespan, age at sexual maturity, and geographic range also appeared in top models explaining host responses to Bd. Several of the species examined are highly understudied with respect to Bd such that this study represents the first experimental susceptibility data. Combining insights gained from experimental studies with observations of landscapelevel disease prevalence may help explain current and predict future pathogen dynamics in the Bd system."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",3,"lnRR56"

We built a new dataset including 636 ratios of organic versus conventional yields covering 37 horticultural species and 17 countries and estimated (i) mean yield ratios, (ii) yield ratio probability distribution across experiments and (iii) interannual yield variances in organic and conventional systems. Our results show that yields in organic horticulture are indeed on average 10 to 32% lower than those in conventional horticulture but they exhibit large variation across experiments. An analysis of yield ratio probability distribution shows that yield loss in organic horticulture has about 10% chances to exceed 50% compared to conventional systems. The analysis gives also around 20% chances to get higher yields in organic horticulture compared to conventional systems. None of the tested covariates (e.g. crop type, climate zone) was able to explain a significant part of the yield ratio variability. We find no evidence of a larger interannual variability (i.e. lower yield stability) in organic versus conventional horticulture. Longer-term trials could nonetheless help substantiate this result.

In the present study, we sought to understand the phenomenon of variability on AMF symbiotic relationship on saline stress amelioration in C3 and C4 plants. Thus, the objective was to compare varied mycorrhizal symbiotic relationship between C3 and C4 plants in saline conditions. To accomplish the above mentioned objective, we conducted a random effects models meta-analysis across 60 published studies. An effect size was calculated as the difference in mycorrhizal responses between the AMF inoculated plants and its corresponding control under saline conditions. Responses were compared between (i) identity of AMF species and AMF inoculation, (ii) identity of host plants (C3 vs. C4) and plant functional groups, (iii) soil texture and level of salinity and (iv) experimental condition (greenhouse vs. field). Results indicate that both C3 and C4 plants under saline condition responded positively to AMF inoculation, thereby overcoming the predicted effects of symbiotic efficiency. Although C3 and C4 plants showed positive effects under low (EC &lt; 4 ds/m) and high (&gt;8 ds/m) saline conditions, C3 plants showed significant effects for mycorrhizal inoculation over C4 plants. Among the plant types, C4 annual and perennial plants, C4 herbs and C4 dicot had a significant effect over other counterparts. Between single and mixed AMF inoculants, single inoculants Rhizophagus irregularis had a positive effect on C3 plants whereas Funneliformis mosseae had a positive effect on C4 plants than other species. In all of the observed studies, mycorrhizal inoculation showed positive effects on shoot, root and total biomass, and in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (K) uptake. However, it showed negative effects in sodium (Na) uptake in both C3 and C4 plants. This influence, owing to mycorrhizal inoculation, was significantly higher in K uptake in C4 plants. For our analysis, we concluded that AMF-inoculated C4 plants showed more competitive K+ ions uptake than C3 plants. Therefore, maintenance of high cytosolic K+/Na+ ratio is a key feature of plant salt tolerance.

Nonindependence can affect two major interrelated components of a meta-analysis: (i) the calculation of effect size statistics and (ii) the estimation of overall meta-analytic estimates and their uncertainty. While some solutions to nonindependence exist at the statistical analysis stages, there is little advice on what to do when complex analyses are not possible, or when studies with nonindependent experimental designs exist in the data. Here we argue that exploring the effects of procedural decisions in a meta-analysis (e.g. inclusion of different quality data, choice of effect size) and statistical assumptions (e.g. assuming no phylogenetic covariance) using sensitivity analyses are extremely important in assessing the impact of nonindependence. Sensitivity analyses can provide greater confidence in results and highlight important limitations of empirical work (e.g. impact of study design on overall effects). Despite their importance, sensitivity analyses are seldom applied to problems of nonindependence. To encourage better practice for dealing with nonindependence in meta-analytic studies, we present accessible examples demonstrating the impact that ignoring nonindependence can have on meta-analytic estimates.

Evaluation of risk of bias (RoB) and overall body of evidence followed guidance developed by the National Toxicology Program. Animal studies using varying designs and outcomes were available for BDEs 47, 99, 153, 203, 206, and 209 and the technical mixture DE-71. Study reporting of methods and results was often incomplete leading to concerns regarding RoB. A meta-analysis of 6 Morris water maze studies showed evidence of a significant increase in last trial latency (effect size of 25.8 [CI, 20.3 to 31.2]) in PBDE-exposed animals with low heterogeneity. For most endpoints, there were unexplained inconsistencies across studies and no consistent evidence of a dose-response relationship. There is a moderate level of evidence that exposure to BDEs 47, 99, and 209 affects learning. For other PBDEs and other endpoints, the level of evidence was low or very low. The meta-analysis led to stronger conclusions than that based upon a qualitative review of the evidence.

However, studies looking at the possible causes of temporal changes in the understorey often lack data on soil and tree layer conditions for the old survey. We investigated how changes in the tree layer, soil, and understorey were related in two contrasting forest types. Methods Full re-inventory of the tree layer (1997, 2010) and resurvey of the soil and understorey in 40 plots on a permanent grid (1993, 2011) in an ancient temperate deciduous forest. The 1.83 ha study area consisted of a part dominated by oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) and a part dominated by ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Key results Overall, the basal area and shade-casting ability of the tree layer had increased. In the oak-beech forest, the soil pH had decreased; below ash, the topsoil pH had increased. The understorey species richness had increased, and the change in species richness was correlated with the change in soil pH and basal area, the latter in the oak-beech forest only. The observed patterns in understorey dissimilarity were different for the dataset including or excluding the regeneration of woody species.Conclusions The changes in soil and understorey differed between the two forest types, and there were some indications of recovery from soil acidification in the ash forest.  2014 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR65"

Climate change is predicted to cause further rise of cyanobacteria blooms as cyanobacteria can have a competitive advantage at elevated temperatures. We tested the hypothesis that simultaneous rise in nutrients and temperature will promote cyanobacteria more than a single increase in one of the two drivers. To this end, controlled experiments were run with seston from 39 different urban water bodies varying in trophic state from mesotrophic to hypertrophic. These experiments were carried out at two different temperatures, 20C (ambient) and 25C (warming scenario) with or without the addition of a surplus of nutrients (eutrophication scenario). To facilitate comparisons, we quantified the effect size of the different treatments, using cyanobacterial and algal chlorophyll a concentrations as a response variable. Cyanobacterial and algal chlorophyll a concentrations were determined with a PHYTO-PAM phytoplankton analyzer. Warming caused an 18% increase in cyanobacterial chlorophyll-, while algal chlorophyll- concentrations were on average 8% higher at 25C than at 20C. A nutrient pulse had a much stronger effect on chlorophyll- concentrations than warming. Cyanobacterial chlorophyll- concentrations in nutrient enriched incubations at 20 or 25C were similar and 9 times higher than in the incubations without nutrient pulse. Likewise, algal chlorophyll- concentrations were 6 times higher. The results of this study confirm that warming alone yields marginally higher cyanobacteria chlorophyll- concentrations, yet that a pulse of additional nutrients is boosting blooms. The responses of seston originating from mesotrophic waters seemed less strong than those from eutrophic waters, which indicates that nutrient control strategies -catchment as well as in-system measures- could increase the resilience of surface waters to the negative effects of climate change.  2018 Lrling, Mendes e Mello, van Oosterhout, de Senerpont Domis and Marinho."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR66"

Contrary to our intuition that tree longevity would best explain the ability of trees to migrate, we found that seed biomass was the only good descriptor of migration potential: trees with heavier seeds lag more. Context: To cope with global warming, the majority of plants have either to migrate polewards or risk extinction. This is why conservationists value predictive models that can flag plant species that may not keep pace with global warming. Aims: To identify which plant traits best explain migration potential in woody species by reanalysing a dataset of tree distribution ranges in Europe. Methods: We used two statistical approaches to quantify migration lag. A direct approach compared frequency of large trees in the two latitudinal extremes and a modelling approach in which we first corrected data for the influence of temperature and then assessed the influence of latitude over the entire distribution of the tree species. Results: Contrary to our intuition that tree longevity would best explain the ability of trees to migrate, we found that seed mass was the only good descriptor of migration potential: trees with heavier seeds lag more. Conclusion: We interpret our results in terms of the well-established trade-off between seed mass and seed production in spermatophytes and discuss the possible functional implications that will result from selectively losing large-seeded trees. In summary, we provide an empirical study on how woody communities will respond to global warming over the next years.  2018, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR67"

One conventional explanation for sex differences in mercury burden suggests female birds should have lower concentrations than conspecific males, because breeding females can depurate methylmercury to their eggs. However, sex differences in body burden of mercury among birds are not consistent. We used meta-analysis to synthesize 123 male-female comparisons of mercury burden from 50 studies. For breeding birds, males had higher concentrations of mercury than did females, supporting egg depuration as a mechanism. However, the percentage of female body mass represented by a clutch did not significantly predict the magnitude of the sex difference in mercury contamination, as predicted. Furthermore, whether species were semialtrical or altrical versus semiprecocial or precocial also did not explain sex differences in mercury burden. Foraging guild of a species did explain near significant variation in sex differences in mercury burden where piscivores and invertivores showed significant sex differences, but sex differences were not detected for carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, and omnivores. The magnitude and direction of sexual size dimorphism did not explain variation in sex differences in mercury burden among breeding birds. We reveal targeted research directions on mechanisms for sex differences in mercury and confirm that sex is important to consider for environmental risk assessments based on breeding birds.  2012 American Chemical Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR68"

However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of SOC stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe. Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods <30 years and >30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.  2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR69"

Irrespective of variable interactions, fertilization type was the major factor impacting soil ionomic behavior and accounted for 15.14% of the overall impact. Sampling site was the major factor affecting soil enzymatic profile and accounted for 34.25% of the overall impact. The availabilities of Pb, La, Ni, Co, Fe and Al were significantly higher in soil with only chemical fertilizer than the soil with organic amendment. Most of the soil enzyme activities, including -glucosidase activity, were significantly activated by organic amendment. Network analysis between the soil ionome and the soil enzyme activities was more complex in the organic-amended soils than in the chemical fertilized soils, whereas the network analysis among the soil ions was less complex with organic amendment. Moreover, -glucosidase was revealed to generally harbor more corrections with the soil ionic availabilities in network. We concluded that some of the soil enzymes activated by organic input can make the soil more vigorous and stable and that the -glucosidase revealed by this analysis might help stabilize the soil ion availability."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR70"

PubMed, Embase, and Toxline were searched for relevant human and experimental animal studies on August 15, 2016. Search results were screened for relevance, and studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for quality and data extracted for analysis. Confidence in the human and animal bodies of evidence was assessed and hazard conclusions reached by integrating evidence streams. The search yielded 6 relevant human studies and 19 animal studies. Meta-analysis of 5 human observational prospective cohort studies showed that increased maternal urinary concentrations of DEHP metabolites were associated with decreased AGD in boys (4.07 [CI, 6.49 to 1.66] % decrease per log10 rise in DEHP metabolites). Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the 19 experimental animal studies found reduced AGD with DEHP treatment, with a dose-response gradient, and with heterogeneity explained by species and strain. There is a moderate level of evidence from human investigations and a high level of data from animal studies that in utero exposure to DEHP decreases AGD. Based upon the available human and animal evidence, and consideration of mechanistic data, DEHP is presumed to be a reproductive hazard to humans on the basis of effects on AGD.  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR71"

After enactment of the Local Government Code of 1991, the government actively promoted community-based fisheries management (CBFM) to conserve the coastal resources. The increased attention paid to community-based fisheries management has come about through experience of the poor performance of other approaches and through the study of traditional systems of community management of natural resources which have not only survived but also appear to perform better than the alternatives. This paper presents the results of a study to assess the impacts of CBFM projects in the Philippines, using meta-analysis, on the equity and sustainability of small-scale coastal fisheries. The outcomes indicate a positive impact of CBFM on the equity of both involvement in management and benefit sharing and sustainable management of fisheries resources through the investigation of effective magnitude (effect size) based on eight indicators. The positive summary effect sizes of participation, influence, control, access, and income conjunctly portrayed an improved equity in the fishing community by implementing CBFM. The positive summary effect sizes of compliance and conflict indicated an affirmative community and, therefore, sustainable fisheries management. While the negative summary effect size of resource revealed the difficulties in recovering fish abundance in a relatively short period of time. Also, ten years of implementation of CBFM was discovered as the minimum duration with perceived equity and sustainability improvement for most indicators."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR72"

Shellfish fitness can be compared between fouled stock and stock which has undergone treatment. As treatment options are often harsh, they may deleteriously affect stock. The projected impact of biofouling may therefore be confounded by the impact of treatments. Given the substantial cost of fouling removal, some have questioned the necessity of biofouling mitigation strategies. Meta-analysis revealed that biofouling typically reduces shellfish fitness. However, the fitness of treated stock was often lower or equal to fouled control stock, indicating that many common antifouling (AF) strategies are ineffective at enhancing farm productivity. Overall, caution and diligence are required to successfully implement biofouling mitigation strategies. The need remains for increased passive prevention approaches and novel AF strategies suitable for shellfish culture, such as strategic siting of bivalve farms in areas of low biofouling larval supply.  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",1,"lnRR73"

Despite substantial advances in adapting meta-analytical techniques for use in ecological sciences from their foundations in medical and social sciences, forest biodiversity research still presents particular challenges to its application. These relate to the long timescales of successional stages, often precluding experimental designs, and the often-large spatial scales required to select random plots for sampling treatment factors of interest. Empirical studies measuring biodiversity responses to forest treatments vary widely in their quality with respect to the number of treatment replicates and the randomness of their allocation to treatment levels, with a high prevalence of pseudoreplicated designs. It has been suggested that meta-analysis can potentially offer a solution to the vast pseudoreplicated literature, because results from pseudoreplicated studies are formative collectively. Here we review the principal issues that arise when including differently designed studies in meta-analyses of forest biodiversity responses to forest management or disturbance, in addition to more general matters of appropriate question formulation and interpretation of synthetic findings. These concern the need for questions of practical value to forest management, appropriate effect size estimation and weighting of primary studies that differ in study design and quality. We recommend against using effect sizes that are standardized against within-study variance when pooling studies across different designs or across factors such as taxonomic group. We find a need for alternative weighting schemes to the conventional inverse of study variance, to account for variation between studies in their design quality as well as their observed precision. Finally, we recommend caution in interpreting results, particularly with regard to the possibility of systematic biases between reference and treatment stands.  2017 The Authors"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}",2,"lnRR74"
