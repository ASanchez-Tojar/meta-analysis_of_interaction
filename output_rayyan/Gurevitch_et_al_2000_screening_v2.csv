,Habitat segregation between sympatric Tibetan argali Ovis ammon hodgsoni and blue sheep Pseudois nayaur in the Indian Trans-Himalaya,2004,1,1,Journal of Zoology,0952-8369,262,1,57-63,"Namgail, T. and Fox, J.L. and Bhatnagar, Y.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1642423818&partnerID=40&md5=76aef2a1337b5d594ecfd7757585895b,English,,,"Tibetan argali Ovis ammon hodgsoni and blue sheep Pseudois nayaur have almost completely overlapping distributions encompassing most of the Tibetan plateau and its margins. Such a sympatric distribution of related species with similar ecological requirements implies that there is some degree of resource partitioning. This may be accomplished on the basis of habitat and/or diet separation. This study evaluated such ecological separation on the basis of physical habitat partitioning by these two sympatric ungulates in Hemis High Altitude National Park, Ladakh, India, in an area where the argali established a small new population in 1978. Such separation was tested for on the basis of expected difference between the species in their proximity to cliffs, associated with species-specific anti-predator behaviour. Tibetan argali selected habitats away from cliffs while blue sheep selected habitats close to cliffs. Blue sheep also selected steep slopes whereas argali selected gentle slopes. The two species did not differ in their use of habitats in terms of elevation. They did, however, differ in their use of plant communities; blue sheep selected sub-shrub and grass-dominated communities whilst argali selected forb-dominated communities. We suggest that the two species coexist in this site as a result of the differential use of habitat associated with their species-specific anti-predator strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"
1762,Interactions between competition and predation shape early growth and survival of two neotropical hylid tadpoles,2011,1,1,Biotropica,,43,,633-639,"Gonzalez, S.C. and Touchon, J.C. and Vonesh, J.R.",10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00748.x,,,,"Experimental studies in temperate regions have revealed that competition and predation interact to shape aquatic communities. Predators typically reduce the effect of competition on growth and competitors provide alternative prey subjects, which may also alter predation. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of competition and predation on the survival and growth of hatchling tadpoles of two widespread co-occurring Neotropical hylid frogs (Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Using 400L mesocosms, we used a 2  3 factorial substitutive design, which crossed tadpole species composition with the presence or absence of a free-roaming predator (Anax amazili dragonfly larva). Dragonflies were effective predators of both species, but had larger effects on A. callidryas survival. Both species had similar growth rates when alone, whereas A. callidryas grew 30 percent faster than D. ebraccatus when they co-occurred, suggesting interspecific rather than intraspecific competition had relatively stronger effects on D. ebraccatus growth, while the opposite was true for A. callidryas. Predator presence dramatically reduced growth rates of both species and erased this asymmetry. Results suggest that the effects of predator induction (i.e., nonconsumptive effects) on growth were larger than both consumptive and competitive effects. Our study demonstrates that predators have strong effects on both survival and growth of prey, highlighting the potential importance of predators in shaping prey populations and tropical aquatic food web interactions.

Abrams2001459,The effect of density-independent mortality on the coexistence of exploitative competitors for renewing resources,2001,1,1,American Naturalist,1537-5323,158,,459-470,"Abrams, P.A.",10.1086/323113,,,,"Many ecologists believe that higher mortality imposed on competing species increases the probability that they will coexist. This belief has persisted in spite of many theoretical counterarguments. However, few of those counterarguments have been based on models having explicit representation of the resources for which competition is occurring. This article analyzes a series of consumer-resource models of competition for nutritionally substitutable renewable resources and determines the range of relative resource requirements that allow coexistence. In most cases, if consumers are initially efficient at reducing resource densities, increasing density-independent mortality, widens the range of resource requirements of the consumers that allow coexistence, provided the increase in mortality is not too great. The coexistence-promoting effects of mortality occur because a very efficient consumer species usually reduces the diversity of the set of resources it consumes. This lessens the extent to which resource utilization differences between consumer species can be expressed. Mortality, in this case, increases the diversity of resource types, widening the conditions for coexistence. However, sufficiently high mortality will usually reduce the range of parameters allowing coexistence, in agreement with much previous theory. The results presented here also predict maximal diversity at intermediate levels of productivity. Previous empirical studies and theory are reviewed in light of the theory developed here."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theoretical | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

In this study, I examined patterns of species co-occurrence among eastern Plethodon salamanders and determined whether they were consistent with predictions from a guild model of competition-based community assembly. Using a database of 45 species and 4540 geographic sites, I found that patterns of co-occurrence were significantly nonrandom at both a regional and continental scale, and species of different size guilds were distributed more evenly in sites than was expected by chance. Sites with the highest species richness had consistent patterns of community composition, and with few exceptions, the same five species were present at all sites. Taken together, these results imply that larger Plethodon communities are assembled from simpler communities in a manner consistent with what is predicted through competitive mechanisms and suggest that stable species combinations are possible to achieve at various levels of species richness. These results also provide strong evidence consistent with the hypothesis that competitive-based community assembly is a general phenomenon in Plethodon and that interspecific competition is prevalent among the eastern species of this group.  2007 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: comparative analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20-30%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse coevolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant-plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Here we provide a comparative study on seasonality of bivalves and gastropods in the tropical intertidal seagrass-covered soft sediment environment of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania (20N, 16W). In this system, benthivorous shorebirds exert considerable predation pressure with strong seasonal variations. It has been proposed that during the period when (adult) shorebirds are absent (May-August) benthic biomass would be able to recover, but a first test was inconclusive. Over a full year (March 2011-February 2012), each month we sampled benthic invertebrates at sixteen permanent sites. The total of 3763 specimens comprised 20 species, representing eight orders and 19 families. Bivalves were much more common than gastropods. The bivalve Loripes lucinalis dominated the assemblage throughout the year (58% of total number), followed by Dosinia isocardia (10%), Senilia senilis (8%) and the gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis (6%). Average biomass amounted to 32 g AFDM/m2, of which the large West-African bloody cockle Senilia made up three-quarter, Loripes 16%, Gibbula 2% and Dosinia 1%. Across the 20 species, lowest densities were reached in late spring (May) and summer (Aug.), whereas highest densities occurred in autumn (Oct.). The lowest overall density of 676 specimens/m2 in August more than doubled to a peak density of 1538 specimens/m2 in October, most of the increase being due to strong recruitment in both Loripes (densities increasing from 322 specimens/m2 in Sept. to 785 specimens/m2 in Oct.) and Dosinia (densities increasing from 18 specimens/m2 in Aug. to 265 specimens/m2 in Sept.). Our results suggest that by the time the feathered molluscivore predators returned in high numbers to Banc d'Arguin (after their summer breeding season in the Arctic), benthic animals were at a peak. In order to quantitatively understand the seasonal changes in mollusc abundance, we build upon a recently published optimal diet model in which the most abundant molluscivore shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), could choose between Loripes and Dosinia. Observed changes in densities of these two bivalves closely match depletion trajectories predicted by the model. We conclude that molluscivore shorebirds are able to deplete their food stocks in the course of their 'winter' in a tropical intertidal area.  2013 The Authors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

These nurse plants may produce the conditions promoting intense competition between coexisting species under the canopy, and canopies may establish stress gradients, where stress increases toward the edge of the canopy. Competition and facilitation on these stress gradients may control species distributions in the communities under canopies. We tested the following predictions: (1) interactions between understory species shift from competition to facilitation in habitats experiencing increasing stress from the center to the edge of canopy of a nurse plant, and (2) species distributions in understory communities are controlled by competitive interactions at the center of canopy, and facilitation at the edge of the canopy. We tested these predictions using a neighbor removal experiment under nurse trees growing in arid environments. Established individuals of each of four of the most common herbaceous species in the understory were used in the experiment. Two species were more frequent in the center of the canopy, and two species were more frequent at the edge of the canopy. Established individuals of each species were subjected to neighbor removal or control treatments in both canopy center and edge habitats. We found a shift from competitive to facilitative interactions from the center to the edge of the canopy. The shift in the effect of neighbors on the target species can help to explain species distributions in these canopies. Canopy-dominant species only perform well in the presence of neighbors in the edge microhabitat. Competition from canopy-dominant species can also limit the performance of edge-dominant species in the canopy microhabitat. The shift from competition to facilitation under nurse plant canopies can structure the understory communities in extremely stressful environments.  2017 The Authors.

Despite the conspicuousness of freshwater invasions, investigations of biotic resistance have focused mostly on terrestrial and, more recently, marine coastal communities. We collected in-situ studies that tested the impacts of native freshwater communities on invading primary producers and consumers. Meta-analysis demonstrated that evidence of competitive biotic resistance in freshwater habitats was not as strong as that in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems consumptive resistance was significantly stronger than competitive resistance and consumptive resistance appeared to be as strong in freshwater as in marine and terrestrial systems. The limited number of studies considering freshwater biotic resistance hindered our ability to understand the importance of factors including latitude, experimental duration, and method. However, the strength of biotic resistance varied among freshwater habitats; specifically, biotic resistance was strongest in lentic environments. Our analysis identifies mechanisms underlying biotic resistance in freshwater ecosystems that warrant further investigation given the potential ongoing and future impacts of invasive species in these systems.  2014 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Experiments of multiple predator effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, as the number of treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments increases exponentially with the number of species in question. Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally predict qualitatively different results, if initial absolute densities of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the absolute initial densities of the species in question. Even if their relative densities are kept constant, the natural enemy species or combination thereof that most effectively suppresses the prey may depend on the absolute initial densities used in the experiment. Future empirical studies of multiple predator - one prey interactions should therefore use a two-dimensional array of initial densities of the studied species. Varying only combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities is not sufficient and can lead to misleading results.  2013 Ameixa et al."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Yet, whether intra- and interspecific competition can have non-additive effects has rarely been tested. The resulting fitness consequences of such non-additive interactions are important to provide the context necessary to advance our understanding of competition theory. We compared the strength of additive and non-additive intra- and interspecific competition by manipulating densities of a pair of larval salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum and A. maculatum) in experimental mesocosms within a response surface design. Intraspecific density had the strongest effect on the strength of competition for both species, and few observed comparisons indicated interspecific competition was an important factor in predicting body size, growth or larval period length of either species. Non-additive effects of intra- and interspecific competition influenced some response variables, including size and mass at metamorphosis in A. maculatum, but at a reduced strength compared to intraspecific effects alone. Intraspecific competition was thus the dominant biotic interaction, but non-additive effects also impact the outcome of competition in these species, validating the importance of testing for and incorporating non-additive density effects into competition models.  2015 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

A null model suggests that IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species) have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence. We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as important to the trophic structuring of communities.

(2) do different species groups (i.e., annuals and perennials, natives and exotics) display different association responses to cushions? (3) does the nurse effect of cushions increase with environmental severity? Results indicated that the overall effect of cushions is positive, however these positive effects were more significant amongst exotic plants than in native plants; effects were only positive for perennial plants, and were notably negative for annuals. The positive effects of cushions also increased with physical stress, but only for perennial plants. These results allow us to suggest that as a whole cushions may be acting as keystone species that maintain the structure and diversity of high-Andean plant communities. Nevertheless, since cushions also positively affect the performance of exotic plants, we should be aware of their potential role in promoting biological invasions.

The relative importance of competition and predation will depend largely on the local assemblage of species, the type of predators, or the degree of niche segregation. We experimentally investigated the interplay of competition and predation on the structure and trophic level (measured via stable isotope analysis) of a seven-species Neotropical freshwater guild using a mesocosm approach in central Panama. We tested the effect of two types of predators (dragonfly nymphs or adult water bugs) in combination with the presence/absence of a common competitor, the red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas), on four core species of tadpoles. We also distinguished between consumptive and non-consumptive effects of each type of predator by presenting them to tadpoles caged or freely roaming. Dragonfly larvae were more efficient predators than water bugs, but these effects were not uniform for all tadpole species. All amphibian species grew bigger when raised in the presence of an uncaged dragonfly nymph, presumably due to reduced competition through thinning, but tadpoles were smaller when exposed to caged dragonfly nymphs indicating the existence of non-consumptive predator effects as well. Predator presence also altered the relative trophic position of the different amphibian species, causing some tadpole species to increase and others to decrease their trophic status. Despite the presumed ecological similarity of tadpole species in the guild, the interplay of competition and predation had varying effects on the trophic status of nearly every species. Our results indicate that community composition can greatly affect the trophic level of larval amphibians, and that predation may have a greater role than competition in structuring Neotropical larval amphibian guilds.  2018 Arribas, Touchon and Gomez-Mestre."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

This variation has often led to opposing conclusions about how UVB affects amphibians. We used meta-analysis techniques to explore the overall effects of UVB radiation on survival in amphibians. We also used recently developed factorial meta-analytic techniques to quantify potential interactions between UVB radiation and other stressors on amphibians. Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by 1.9-fold compared with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible to damage from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental stressors and resulted in greater than additive effects on survival when 2 stressors were present.

Patterns varied depending on plant life form (woody, herbaceous, grass), type of herbivore (insect, mollusk, mammal), and type of defense trait (secondary chemistry, physical defense, tolerance). In woody plants, chemical defense increased during the seedling stage, followed by an increase in physical defenses during the vegetative juvenile stage. Mammalian herbivores showed a strong preference for mature compared to juvenile tissues in woody plants. Herbs experienced a significant increase in secondary chemistry across the entire ontogenetic trajectory, although the magnitude of increase was greatest during the seedling stage. Correspondingly, mollusks preferred young compared to older herbs.

This book covers issues of structure, function, scaling, complexity, and stability in the contexts of conservation, fisheries, and climate. Although the focus of this volume is upon aquatic food webs (where many of the recent advances have been made), many other issues are addressed.  Oxford University Press, 2005.

Predators may influence mosquito prey populations through both lethal effect and non-lethal pathways. A series of experimental manipulations were used to distinguish between lethal (density-mediated interaction) and non-lethal (trait-mediated interaction) effects in a model system comprised of invasive prey mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and a predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. Treatments with predators present or manipulations mimicking daily mortality (density reduction) reduced developmental time and recruitment to the adult stage. Daily records of adult survival of A. aegypti showed that exposure to predators during the juvenile stage shortened the lifespan of adults. This was also observed in treatments, where A. aegypti were replaced at the rate of consumption by T. rutilus. In contrast, numerical reductions in A. aegypti that mimicked daily rate of predation led to adults with the longest lifespan. These observations suggest strong effects of density and trait-mediated interactions in the influence of predators on mosquito biology relevant to their ability to transmit pathogens. These results have potentially important implications for disease control strategies. The primary approach to reduce risk of mosquito-borne diseases is through population reduction of the vectors. We show an unanticipated benefit of biological control by predation for the control of juvenile stages of mosquitoes. Specifically, mosquitoes that are exposed to predators but survive to adulthood will have compromised life expectancy, a key parameter in determining risk of disease transmission.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The processes of selection and competition can have substantial effects on prey population dynamics, but are rarely studied simultaneously. Moreover, field studies of predator-induced short-term selection pressures on prey populations are scarce. Here we report measurements of density dependence in body composition in a bivalve prey (edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule) during bouts of intense predation by an avian predator (Red Knot, Calidris canutus). We measured densities, patchiness, morphology, and body composition (shell and flesh mass) of cockles in a quasi-experimental setting, i.e., before and after predation in three similar plots of 1 ha each, two of which experienced predation, and one of which remained unvisited in the course of the short study period and served as a reference. An individual's shell and flesh mass declined with cockle density (negative density dependence). Before predation, cockles were patchily distributed. After predation, during which densities were reduced by 78% (from 232 to 50 cockles/m2), the patchiness was substantially reduced, i.e., the spatial distribution was homogenized. Red Knots selected juvenile cockles with an average length of 6. 6 1.0 mm (mean  SD). Cockles surviving predation had heavier shells than before predation (an increase of 21.5 percentage points), but similar flesh masses. By contrast, in the reference plot shell mass did not differ statistically between initial and final sampling occasions, while flesh mass was larger (an increase of 13.2 percentage points). In this field study, we show that Red Knots imposed a strong selection pressure on cockles to grow fast with thick shells and little flesh mass, with selection gradients among the highest reported in the literature.  2015 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Using data on forest-dwelling hawks from Finland, we addressed the impact of an IG predator, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis (goshawk), on the breeding of an IG prey, the common buzzard Buteo buteo. We hypothesized that the subordinate common buzzard avoids breeding in the proximity of goshawks and that interspecific competitors, mainly Strix owls, may also disturb common buzzards by competing for nests and food. Our results show that common buzzards more frequently occupied territories with a low IG predation threat and with no interspecific competitors. We also observed that common buzzards avoided territories with high levels of grouse, the main food of goshawks, possibly due to a risk of IG predation since abundant grouse can attract goshawks. High levels of small rodents attracted interspecific competitors to common buzzard territories and created a situation where there was not only an abundance of food but also an abundance of competitors for the food. These results suggest interplay between topdown and bottomup processes which influence the interactions between avian predator species. We conclude that the common buzzard needs to balance the risks of IG predation and interference competition with the availability of its own resources. The presence of other predators associated with high food levels may impede a subordinate predator taking full advantage of the available food. Based on our results, it appears that interspecific interactions with dominant predators have the potential to influence the distribution pattern of subordinate predators.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Yet, the roles of controphic species of mosquito larvae in affecting mosquito populations have received little attention. Published empirical evidence, although scarce, suggests that controphic species such as zooplankton and anuran larvae compete with mosquito larvae, can positively affect mosquito larvae by consuming bacteria that are pathogenic to mosquito larvae, reduce predation on mosquito larvae by serving as alternative prey, and ultimately cause increased predation on mosquito larvae by causing a numerical response in the predator. We conclude that more extensive theoretical and empirical studies in elucidating the roles of controphic species will better allow us to predict mosquito population dynamics and allow for better management of mosquitoes.

The response of life history events to the NAO was similar in all environments but less pronounced at higher latitudes. The magnitude of the biomass response was significantly related to the NAO, either positively in aquatic or negatively in terrestrial ecosystems. The response depended on longitude, the effect being less pronounced in Eastern Europe.

A meta-analysis approach was chosen because we wished to emphasize the overall coherence pattern rather than individual lake responses. A particular strength of our approach is that time-series from each of the 18 lakes were subjected to the same robust statistical analysis covering the same 23-year period. Although the strongest overall coherence in response to the winter NAO was exhibited by lake water temperatures, a strong, coherent response was also exhibited by concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus and soluble reactive silicate, most likely as a result of the coherent response exhibited by the spring phytoplankton bloom. Lake nitrate concentrations showed significant coherence in winter. With the exception of the cyanobacterial biomass in summer, phytoplankton biomass in all seasons was unrelated to the winter NAO. A strong coherence in the abundance of daphnids during spring can most likely be attributed to coherence in daphnid phenology. A strong coherence in the summer abundance of the cyclopoid copepods may have been related to a coherent change in their emergence from resting stages.

Dual-guild herbivory also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivoreherbivore interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52 working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a 30% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae), and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites. Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism: herbivoreherbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.  2018 by the Ecological Society of America"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

When occurring simultaneously, responses to one interaction can constrain the induction of responses to the other interaction due to resource limitation and other interactive effects. Thus, to maximize fitness when interacting with competitors and herbivores, plants are likely to express particular combinations of plastic responses. This study reports the interactive effects of herbivory and competition on responses induced in Tithonia tubaeformis plants and describes how natural selection acts on particular plastic responses and on their different combinations. Competition induced a stem elongation response, expressed through an increase in height and mean internode length, together with a decrease in basal diameter. Interestingly, realized, resistance increased in both competition and herbivory treatments, suggesting a plastic response in both constitutive and induced resistance traits. Particular combinations of plastic responses defined three plant phenotypes: vigorous, elongated, and resistant plants. The ecological context in which plants grew modified the traits and the particular combinations of plastic responses that were favored by selection. Vigorous plants were favored by selection in all environments, except when they were damaged by herbivores in the absence of neighbors. The combination of responses defining an elongated plant phenotype was favored by selection in crowded conditions. Resistance was negatively selected in the absence of competition and herbivory but favored in the presence of both interactions. In addition, contextual analyses detected that population structure in heterogeneous environments can also influence the outcomes of selection. These findings suggest that natural selection can act on particular combinations of plastic responses, which may allow plants to adjust their phenotypes to those that promote greater fitness under particular ecological conditions.  2010 by the Ecological society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

In contrast, while plants are increased by fertilization, this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in either the presence or absence of predators. These patterns are consistent among marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems and are largely independent of study size and duration.

When plants are stressed by herbivory the net effect of the symbiosis may be altered tolerance. Individual experiments manipulating AM fungi and herbivory have demonstrated increased, decreased, and no effect on tolerance but patterns with respect to plant, herbivore, or fungus characteristics have not emerged. Meta-analysis of published results from factorial experiments was used to describe the size of the effects of herbivory and of AM fungi on host growth when factors such as cause of damage, inoculum, and host characteristics are considered, and to determine whether AM fungi alter the effects of herbivory. Also, the correlation between the effect of AM fungi on tolerance and resistance was tested with data from studies that examined insect performance. Herbivory strongly and consistently reduced shoot and root growth, especially in perennial plants and crops. AM fungi increased shoot growth of perennials but not annuals, and when insects caused damage but not when artificial defoliation was applied. Root growth was consistently greater with AM fungi. The interaction of AM fungi and herbivory, which indicates whether AM fungi alter the effects of herbivory, was variable and never significant overall but homogeneity tests indicated underlying structure. In experiments that used single species inoculum, Glomus intraradices increased, whereas Glomus mosseae reduced, effects of herbivory on shoot growth. Multispecies inocula magnified effects of herbivory on root growth whereas single species inocula ameliorated effects. The impact of AM fungi on resistance to herbivory was positively correlated with the impact on tolerance; however AM fungi reduced both tolerance and resistance in many cases.

Combining models of predator-prey and producer-nutrient interactions with a structural model of complex food webs, I investigated these two aspects in a dynamic food-web model. While competitive exclusion leads to persistence of only one producer species in 99.7% of the simulated simple producer communities without consumers, embedding the same producer communities in complex food webs generally yields producer coexistence. In simple producer communities, the producers with the most efficient nutrient-intake rates increase in biomass until they competitively exclude inferior producers. In food webs, herbivory predominantly reduces the biomass density of those producers that dominated in producer communities, which yields a more even biomass distribution. In contrast to prior analyses of simple modules, this facilitation of producer coexistence by herbivory does not require a trade-off between the nutrient-intake efficiency and the resistance to herbivory. The local network structure of food webs (top-down effects of the number of herbivores and the herbivores' maximum consumption rates) and the nutrient supply (bottom-up effect) interactively determine the relative biomass densities of the producer species. A strong negative feedback loop emerges in food webs: factors that increase producer biomasses also increase herbivory, which reduces producer biomasses. This negative feedback loop regulates the coexistence and biomass patterns of the producers by balancing biomass increases of producers and biomass fluxes to herbivores, which prevents competitive exclusion.  2008 The Royal Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theoretical | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

In tropical amphibians predation and competition have been suggested to play a major role. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae display a trend towards the use of very small pools and increased parental care, particularly in the genus Dendrobates. Some species with female parental care, asymmetrical biparental care and biparental care, have evolved novel behaviors in association with the use very small phytotelmata. It has been hypothesized that selection pressure imposed by predation and competition favored the use of small phytotelmata, and this, in turn, produced selection for trophic egg provisioning to ameliorate the lack of available nutrients. To elucidate the ecological factors associated with the transition from uniparental male care to biparental care and associated changes in social behaviors, we evaluated key behavioral and ecological differences between Dendrobates imitator and D. variabilis. Dendrobates imitator used significantly smaller phytotelmata in different plant species than D. variabilis for tadpole and embryo deposition. The parental strategy of D. variabilis was limited to male parental care, whereas D. imitator exhibited biparental care. Males and females of D. variabilis were observed to have a promiscuous mating system with little mate fidelity. This contrasted with D. imitator, where paired males and females were observed interacting daily and were never observed courting additional mates. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a key ecological difference between these species, involving the size of pools typically used for reproduction, is strongly associated with the evolution of biparental care and monogamy in D. imitator.  2008 Brill Academic Publishers."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and CO2 interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive effect and CO2 has a negative effect on both growth and calcification. For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO2 impacts. Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope upon which CO2 effects can act in food-replete situations. These interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic approach.

Thus, identifying the relative and synergistic roles of these forces and how they differ across habitats, ecosystems, or primary-producer types is increasingly important for understanding how communities are structured. We used factorial meta-analysis of 54 field experiments that orthogonally manipulated herbivore pressure and nutrient loading to quantify consumer and nutrient effects on primary producers in benthic marine habitats. Across all experiments and producer types, herbivory and nutrient enrichment both significantly affected primary-producer abundance. They also interacted to create greater nutrient enrichment effects in the absence of herbivores, suggesting that loss of herbivores produces more dramatic effects of nutrient loading. Herbivores consistently had stronger effects than did nutrient enrichment for both tropical macroalgae and seagrasses. The strong effects of herbivory but limited effects of nutrient enrichment on tropical macroalgae suggest that suppression of herbivore populations has played a larger role than eutrophication in driving the phase shift from coral- to macroalgal-dominated reefs in many areas, especially the Caribbean. For temperate macroalgae and benthic microalgae, the effects of top-down and bottom-up forces varied as a function of the inherent productivity of the ecosystem. For these algal groups, nutrient enrichment appeared to have stronger effects in high- vs. low-productivity systems, while herbivores exerted a stronger top-down effect in low-productivity systems. Effects of herbivores vs. nutrients also varied among algal functional groups (crustose algae, upright macroalgae, and filamentous algae), within a functional group between temperate and tropical systems, and according to the metric used to measure producer abundance. These analyses suggest that human alteration of food webs and nutrient availability have significant effects on primary producers but that the effects vary among latitudes and primary producers, and with the inherent productivity of ecosystems.  2006 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Octopuses are notorious predators of decapod crustaceans, and their use of crevice shelters suggests that they may also compete for shelter with their lobster prey. Lobsters use mainly chemical cues to detect and avoid octopus, so we hypothesized that the negative association between these species may be as much the consequence of avoidance of a superior competitor as it is of direct predation. Surveys of lobsters and octopuses occupying artificial shelters at 19 hard-bottom sites confirmed that lobsters do not share dens with octopuses, and also show that lobster and octopus abundances are negatively correlated. Tethering experiments on a subset of those sites revealed that predation on lobster was indeed higher on sites with more octopuses. Results from mesocosm studies indicated that although juvenile lobsters do not attain a size refuge from octopus predation, the presence of alternative prey and lobster conspecifics reduces the risk of predation on lobster by octopus. Mesocosm experiments also showed that octopuses were the competitive dominants when shelter was limited. Thus, the negative association between lobster and octopus in the field appears to be driven by both predation and avoidance of octopus-rich sites by lobsters, rather than competition per se. However, crevice shelters suitable for juvenile lobster are limited in many hard-bottom areas in the Florida Keys, so areas where octopuses are abundant may further limit the local accessibility of shelters for juvenile spiny lobsters even if the direct effects of predation by octopus are minimal.

I found that immigration increased local diversity. Further, in animal studies, diversity appears maximized at intermediate dispersal rates but not with plant studies; however, more standardized studies are needed.

For the quantitative assessment, we conducted an analysis of 240 published meta-analyses to examine trends in ecological meta-analyses. Our examination shows that publication rates of meta-analyses in ecology have increased through time, and that more recent meta-analyses have been more comprehensive, including more studies and a greater temporal range of studies. Meta-analyses in ecology are the result of larger collaborations with meta-analyses being authored by larger teams than other studies, and those funded by collaborative centers have even larger collaborations. These larger collaborations result in a larger scope and scale of the analyses-by using more papers, datasets, species and years of data. Qualitatively, we discuss three examples: the strength of competition, the nature of how biodiversity affects ecosystem function, and the response of species to global climate change, where meta-analyses supplied the critical evaluation of accepted ecological explanations. As scientific criticism and controversy mount, the true power of meta-analyses is to serve as the capstone evidence supporting the validity of an explanation and to possibly herald the shift to other potential explanations.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

However, ecologists have often overlooked the consequences of this variation for local communities by assuming that species occupying similar trophic positions are functionally similar. There have been few experimental tests of this important assumption. We tested the assumption of functional similarity by comparing the effect of six different predators (three fish and three salamander species) on an ensemble of larval anuran prey. Our experiment identified substantial variation in the impact of different predators on a variety of responses. Differences among predators in their selection of prey caused the structure of the larval anuran ensemble to vary continuously as opposed to producing discrete alternative states. Predators also differed in their ability to suppress either the total number or biomass of anurans. Thus, performance of larval anurans was dependent upon the identity of the predator. Moreover, the identity of predators judged similar and their degree of similarity depends on the specific response variable. In our study we found no predominance of weak or strong interactors, as predators appear to be evenly distributed along a gradient of interaction strengths. Knowledge of the identity of the species occupying a particular trophic position is crucial to predicting the impact of that trophic position on a community. Ecologists should not simply assume that species are functionally similar. The differing effects of different predators suggest that variation in their distribution across complex landscapes influences prey number, biomass, population dynamics, distribution, and ultimately local and regional species diversity."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Out-migrating anadromous salmonids make rapid transitions between habitat types resulting in large pulses of individuals into a given location over a short period, which may have significant impact on demand for local resources. We evaluated the spatial and temporal variation in IGF-1 concentrations (a proxy for growth rate) and the relationship between size and concentration for juvenile Chinook salmon in Puget Sound, WA, USA, as a function of the relative size and abundance of both Chinook salmon and Pacific herring, a species which commonly co-occurs with salmonids in nearshore marine habitats. The abundance of Chinook salmon and Pacific herring varied substantially among the sub-basins as function of outmigration timing and spawn timing, respectively, while size varied systematically and consistently for both species. Mean IGF-1 concentrations were different among sub-basins, although patterns were not consistent through time. In general, size was positively correlated with IGF-1 concentration, although the slope of the relationship was considerably higher where Pacific herring were more abundant than Chinook salmon; specifically where smaller individual herring, relative to Chinook salmon, were more abundant. Where Pacific herring were less abundant than Chinook salmon, IGF-1 concentrations among small and large Chinook salmon were more variable and showed no consistent increase for larger individuals. The noticeable positive effect of relative Pacific herring abundance on the relationship between size and individual growth rates likely represents a shift to predation based on increased IGF-1 concentrations for individual Chinook salmon that are large enough to incorporate fish into their diet and co-occur with the highest abundances of Pacific herring.  2017 The Authors.

Predation has been claimed to increase, decrease, or have little effect on, the strength, impact or importance of interspecific competition. There is confusion about both the meaning of these terms and the likelihood of, and conditions required for, each of these outcomes. In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of predation on competitive outcomes: Short-term per capita consumption or growth rates, long-term changes in density, and the probability of competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms that can lead to qualitatively distinct effects of predators. The qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of competition and on the definition of competitive strength/impact. In assessing the empirical literature, we ask: (1) What definitions of competitive strength/impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce a given outcome? (3) Do biases in the choice of organism or manipulation exist, and are they likely to have influenced the conclusions reached?

The molecular phylogenies of Mandarina show that a divergence of arboreal, semiarboreal, and ground-dwelling species has occurred repeatedly in different times, areas, and lineages. Ecological diversification is suggested to be important for the coexistence of Mandarina species based on the facts that sympatric species are typically highly differentiated ecologically and morphologically, and that species occupying similar habitats do not coexist. The ecological diversification of Mandarina has occurred without much genetic divergence compared with that of its mainland relatives. This suggests that morphological and ecological diversifications are accelerated in depauperate environments where there are fewer competitors and predators. Although the details of the reproductive isolation mechanisms are not understood and further examination is needed, the rapid evolution of prezygotic isolation is the main cause of speciation in Mandarina. In particular, ecological diversification may be an effective barrier to gene exchange between two species. Because of incomplete post-mating isolation and the lower genetic divergence among species of Mandarina, breakdowns of reproductive isolation have frequently occurred as a result of habitat change. It is important to estimate the effect of hybridization on species diversification in future studies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We conducted a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive and quantitative synthesis of conditions under which ORs, N fertilizers, and combined ORs with N fertilizers positively or negatively influence Zea mays (maize) yields, agronomic N use efficiency and soil organic C (SOC) in SSA. Four OR quality classes were assessed; classes I (high quality) and II (intermediate quality) had >2.5% N while classes III (intermediate quality) and IV (low quality) had <2.5% N and classes I and III had <4% polyphenol and <15% lignin. On the average, yield responses over the control were 60%, 84% and 114% following the addition of ORs, N fertilizers and ORs + N fertilizers, respectively. There was a general increase in yield responses with increasing OR quality and OR-N quantity, both when ORs were added alone or with N fertilizers. Surprisingly, greater OR residual effects were observed with high quality ORs and declined with decreasing OR quality. The greater yield responses with ORs + N fertilizers than either resource alone were mostly due to extra N added and not improved N utilization efficiency because negative interactive effects were, most often, observed when combining ORs with N fertilizers. Additionally, their agronomic N use efficiency was not different from sole added ORs but lower than N fertilizers added alone. Nevertheless, positive interactive effects were observed in sandy soils with low quality ORs whereas agronomic use efficiency was greater when smaller quantities of N were added in all soils. Compared to sole added ORs, yield responses for the combined treatment increased with decreasing OR quality and greater yield increases were observed in sandy (68%) than clayey soils (25%). While ORs and ORs + N fertilizer additions increased SOC by at least 12% compared to the control, N fertilizer additions were not different from control suggesting that ORs are needed to increase SOC. Thus, the addition of ORs will likely improve nutrient storage while crop yields are increased and more so for high quality ORs. Furthermore, interactive effects are seldom occurring, but agronomic N use efficiency of ORs + N fertilizers were greater with low quantities of N added, offering potential for increasing crop productivity.

Such interactions may have positive or negative consequences for plant fitness and could serve as an important ecological and evolutionary constraint on the expression of these responses. In this article, I illustrate the potential for plastic responses in plants to physiologically interact, with particular reference to Arabidopsis thaliana.

In this study we examine the effects over three seasons of a visually striking herbivory event: periodical cicada (Magicicada cassini) oviposition into an early successional tree community in the prairie-forest ecotone in eastern Kansas. Oviposition damage during cicada emergence in 1998 was large in overall magnitude, highly variable in space and varied by host tree species. From 1998-2000 we monitored four measures of tree growth on individuals of each tree species on the study site, and infructescence production on the dominant species (rough leaved dogwood, Cornus drummondii). Cicada damage in 1998 was regressed against each measure of tree performance in following years. Only a few statistically significant results were found. Overall, we concluded that the widespread oviposition damage from periodical cicadas did not have any important effects on successional dynamics of the host plants, suggesting that the trees appeared to compensate sufficiently for physiological damage during the emergence. We suggest that documenting the absence of substantial impacts from episodes of herbivory is useful in gauging the general significance of herbivory in succession."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist.

Treatments were maintained in Plexiglas enclosures over a 7-week period with 0, 1 , 2  and 4  ambient biomass of each species alone, as well as mixed species treatments at 2  and 4  ambient. Snail responses to treatments were almost identical in field and laboratory experiments. Growth rates of both species were reduced by increased density of snails indicating strong intra- and interspecific competition among E. cahawbensis and E. carinifera. An analysis of the strengths of intra- and interspecific competition indicated minimal differences for either species, implying a lack of Competitive dominance. Although periphyton biomass was generally highest without snails, there was little difference in periphyton biomass and snail production over the four-fold density range, regardless of species composition. These results suggest that E. cahawbensis and E. carinifera are functionally redundant with density-dependent responses in growth rate resulting in similar grazing pressure across a density gradient.

The gradient has often been attributed to changes in the interactions between microtines and their predators. Although the spatial structure of the environment is known to influence predator-prey dynamics of a wide range of species, it has scarcely been considered in relation to the Fennoscandian gradient. Furthermore, the length of microtine breeding season also displays a north-south gradient. However, little consideration has been given to its role in shaping or generating population cycles. Because these factors covary along the gradient it is difficult to distinguish their effects experimentally in the field. The distinction is here attempted using realistic agent-based modelling. Methodology/Principal Findings: By using a spatially explicit computer simulation model based on behavioural and ecological data from the field vole (Microtus agrestis), we generated a number of repeated time series of vole densities whose mean population size and amplitude were measured. Subsequently, these time series were subjected to statistical autoregressive modelling, to investigate the effects on vole population dynamics of making predators more specialised, of altering the breeding season, and increasing the level of habitat fragmentation. We found that fragmentation as well as the presence of specialist predators are necessary for the occurrence of population cycles. Habitat fragmentation and predator assembly jointly determined cycle length and amplitude. Length of vole breeding season had little impact on the oscillations. Significance: There is good agreement between our results and the experimental work from Fennoscandia, but our results allow distinction of causation that is hard to unravel in field experiments. We hope our results will help understand the reasons for cycle gradients observed in other areas. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of landscape fragmentation for population cycling and we recommend that the degree of fragmentation be more fully considered in future analyses of vole dynamics.  2011 Dalkvist et al."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The most likely long-term scenario was that the susceptible genotype outcompeted the resistant genotype.

We hypothesized that the effects of conspecific density on tadpole survival and growth would be dependent on the presence of fish predators. Stickleback predation significantly decreased Wood Frog survival; however, a trend of higher tadpole survival with fish was detected at high conspecific densities. Wood Frog time to and mass at metamorphosis was not significantly affected by either conspecific density or stickleback presence.

However, few experimental studies have attempted to determine the importance of the effects of grass clipping (= simulated grazing) on biotic interactions between plant species in the field. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the establishment of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra seedlings would vary with grass clipping and also soil nutrient level, owing to changes in the nature and intensity of biotic interactions. For both Pinus species, we found contrasting effects of the herbaceous cover on seedlings according to the life stage and the nutrient level. The net effects of the herbaceous cover on seedling recruitment rate switched from facilitation to competition with soil fertilization. The soil nutrient level also modified the impact of grass clipping on pine seedlings. On fertilized soils, clipping decreased competition intensity and increased the recruitment of pine seedlings. On non-fertilized soils, clipping decreased Pinus sylvestris recruitment but did not affect Pinus nigra recruitment. In the study area, under natural conditions, the herbaceous cover had a net positive effect on seedling recruitment owing to higher emergence. Grass clipping should not favour pine invasion in the absence of fertilization, but moderate grazing could favour the recruitment of Pinus nigra compared to Pinus sylvestris. Although an exotic species, Pinus nigra had a wider range of favourable conditions for recruitment than Pinus sylvestris. The effects of grazing on woody plant invasion are expected to differ strongly according to grazing intensity, the abiotic conditions, and the target species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The effects of global climate change are predicted to be strongest in the Arctic. This, as well as the suitability of tundra as a simple model ecosystem, has led to many field experiments investigating consequences of simulated environmental change. 2. On the basis of 36 experiments reviewed here, minor light attenuation by clouds, small changes in precipitation, and increases in UV-B radiation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations will not affect arctic plants in the short term. However, temperature elevation, increases in nutrient availability and major decreases in light availability will cause an immediate plant-growth response and alter nutrient cycling, possibly creating positive feedbacks on plant biomass. The driver of future change in arctic vegetation is likely to be increased nutrient availability, arising for example from temperature-induced increases in mineralization. 3. Arctic plant species differ widely in their response to environmental manipulations. Classification into plant functional types proved largely unsatisfactory for generalization of responses and predictions of effects. 4. Nevertheless, a few generalizations and consistent differences between PFTs were detected. Responses to fertilization were the strongest, particularly in grasses. Shrubs and grasses were most responsive to elevated temperature. 5. Future studies should focus on interactive effects of environmental factors, investigate long-term responses to manipulations, and incorporate interactions with other trophic levels. With respect to plant functional types, a new approach is advocated, which groups species according to their responses to environmental manipulations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Available evidence in social mammals aimed to examine this issue remains controversial. Studies show positive (i.e. potentially adaptive), neutral or even negative fitness effects of group living. Attempts to explain this variation rely on intrinsic and extrinsic factors to social groups. Thus, relatively more positive fitness effects are predicted in singularly breeding as opposed to plural breeding species. Fitness effects of sociality in turn may depend on ecological conditions (i.e. extrinsic factors) that influence associated benefits and costs. We used meta-analytic tools to review how breeding strategy or ecological conditions influence the effect size associated with direct fitness-sociality relationships reported in the mammalian literature. Additionally, we determined how taxonomic affiliation of species studied, different fitness and sociality measures used, and major climatic conditions of study sites explained any variation in direct fitness effect size. We found group living had modest, yet positive effects on direct fitness. This generally adaptive scenario was contingent not only upon breeding strategy and climate of study sites, but also on fitness measures examined. Thus, positive and significant effects characterized singular as opposed to plural breeding strategies. 6.We found more positive fitness effects on studies conducted in tropical as opposed to temperate or arid climates. More positive and significant effects were noted on studies that relied on group fecundity, male fecundity and offspring survival as measures of fitness. 7.To conclude, direct fitness consequences of mammalian group living are driven by interspecific differences in breeding strategy and climate conditions. Other factors not examined in this study, namely individual variation in direct and indirect fitness benefits and potential interactions between social and ecological conditions, may be important and require further studies.  2012 The Authors.

Competition can influence patterns of distribution, abundance, and resource use in many systems but remains difficult to measure. We quantified competition between two sympatric small mammals, Keens mice (Peromyscus keeni) and dusky shrews (Sorex monticolus), in four habitat types on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. We related shrew density to that of mice using standardized regression models while accounting for habitat variables in each year from 20102012, during which mice populations peaked (2011) and then crashed (2012). Additionally, we measured dietary overlap and segregation using stable isotope analysis and kernel utilization densities and estimated the change in whole community energy consumption among years. We observed an increase in densities of dusky shrews after mice populations crashed in 2012 as expected under competitive release. In addition, competition coefficients revealed that the influence of Keens mice was dependent on their density. Also in 2012, shrew diets shifted, indicating that they were able to exploit resources previously used by mice. Nonetheless, increases in shrew numbers only partially compensated for the community energy consumption because, as insectivores, they are unlikely to utilize all food types consumed by their competitors. In pre-commercially thinned stands, which exhibit higher diversity of resources compared to other habitat types, shrew populations were less affected by changes in mice densities. These spatially and temporally variable interactions between unlikely competitors, observed in a relatively simple, high-latitude island ecosystem, highlight the difficulty in assessing the role of biotic factors in structuring communities.  2018 Eckrich et al.

Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavymetals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3% decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis.We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global decline. 2012 The Authors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

An endangered Hawaiian shrub, Delissea rbytidosperma (Campanulaceae), produces fruits and viable seeds, but no regeneration has been observed in the wild. We used cages and vegetation removal to explore direct and indirect effects of three groups of nonnative species on suspected seed predation of this endangered plant: a mat-forming grass (Oplismenus hirtellus), rats (Rattus spp.), and invertebrates. Substantial seed removal occurred in all treatments. Both rat exclusion and clearing of nonnative vegetation had strong significant negative effects on seed removal. Highest removal rates occurred with rats not excluded and vegetation present, and lowest removal occurred when rats were excluded and vegetation cleared. Without rat exclosures, 100% of seeds were removed within 15 days. Even when protected from rats, most seeds were removed by smaller herbivores, unless ground vegetation was cleared. Vegetation appears to harbor invertebrates that eat seeds, including nonnative slugs.

I performed a factorial transplant experiment to test the roles of plant-plant interactions, herbivory by mammal grazers and resource availability for plant performance in two contrasting habitat types in a mountain tundra environment. 2. Three perennial dicot herbs, Solidago virgaurea, Erigeron uniflorus and Saussurea alpina, were used as target plants to study the effects of neighbour removal and grazer exclusion, and nutrient enrichment and liming on plant growth, survival and reproductive success. These treatments were replicated in two contrasting habitat types, infertile acidic and fertile non-acidic tundra heaths. 3. The effects of plant-plant interactions on Saussurea varied from facilitation in infertile acidic habitats to competition in fertile non-acidic habitats and in nutrient-enriched conditions, while the overall performance of Saussurea was strongly negatively influenced by the presence of grazers, the effects being greater when plants were fertilized and in fertile non-acidic heaths. Erigeron performed better under nutrient-enriched conditions than in unfertilized plots, when neighbours had been removed. Solidago was negatively affected by grazing and this impact was greater in nutrient-enriched plots and in non-acidic heaths than in acidic heaths and for unfertilized controls. There were no interactions between neighbour removal and herbivory in any of the three species, indicating that these processes operated independently. 4. Grazer-preferred tall plants are strongly limited by consumption by mammal herbivores in nutrient-enriched conditions and in inherently fertile habitats. By contrast, arctic-alpine specialists and species of low stature experience increased competition with neighbouring vegetation in fertile habitats and in enriched nutrient conditions. 5. Synthesis. Overall, the results suggest that the strength and directions of plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions depend on plant species identity and are modified by soil edaphic factors to govern vegetation processes in tundra plant communities. These findings have important implications for understanding the forces structuring vegetation in barren tundra ecosystems under a changing environment.  2007 The Author."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

However, mechanisms that drive herbivore specialization between resource patches are still poorly known. In this study, we tested three hypotheses related to variation in host plant phenology and community structure (i.e., composition, richness, and abundance) of gall-forming species: (a) plants with early leaf-flushing in the season will have greater vegetative growth and high contents of secondary chemical compounds; (b) gall-inducing insect community structure changes among temporary resource patches of the host; and (c) interspecific competition is a probable mechanism that drives gall-inducing insect community structure on Copaifera langsdorffii. We monitored daily a total of 102 individuals of the super-host C.langsdorffii from August 2012 to May 2013, to characterize the leaf flushing time of each host plant. The leaf flushing time had a positive relationship with the number of folioles per branch and a negative relationship with branch growth. We sampled a total of 4,906 galls belonging to 24 gall-inducing insect species from 102 individuals of C.langsdorffii. In spite of some gall-inducing species presented high abundance on early leaf-flushing plants, direct and indirect effects of plant phenology on galling insect abundance was species dependent. At the community level, our study revealed that the quality and quantity of plant resources did not affect the richness and abundance of gall-inducing insects associated with C.langsdorffii. However, the richness and composition of gall-inducing species varied according to the variation in leaf flushing time of the host plant. The results of null model analysis showed that galls co-occurrence on C.langsdorffii trees differ more than expected by chance and that interspecific competition can be one potential mechanism structuring this gall-inducing insect community.  2018 The Authors.

The model incorporates both density-mediated and trait- mediated host-parasitoid interactions. Our analysis shows that the model possesses much richer and more realistic dynamics than earlier models. Our theoretical results reveal a new mechanism for stable coexistence in a three-species community in which any two species alone do not co-exist. More specifically, it is known that, when a predator is introduced into a community of two competing species, if the predator only predates on the strong competitor, it can allow the weak competitor to survive, but may drive the strong competitor to extinction through over-exploitation. We show that if the weak competi- tor interferes the predation on the strong competitor through trait-mediated indirect effects, then all three species can stably co-exist."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theoretical | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Previous studies have demonstrated the important role that predators play in this process but not the impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis; family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3) predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish; implying low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and interspecific competition can play in the outcomes of post-settlement predation.  2008 Springer-Verlag."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

A variety of choices are made in these models: exponential or logistic prey growth in the absence of a predator, various forms of predator functional response, and uni- or bi-directional trait axes. In addition, some form of trade-offs are assumed in order to prevent run-away evolution of the prey and predator traits. While there is a considerable amount of theory regarding various forms of prey growth rates and predator functional responses, only a few studies have explored how different types of trade-offs affect predator-prey dynamics. Here, we compared two ditrophic coevolution models incorporating different trade-offs via dual effects of the prey trait on attack rate and either prey carrying capacity or intrinsic growth rate. We employed a standard dynamical systems approach to analyze the equilibrium conditions of each model and find conditions for non-equilibrium oscillatory coexistence. The exact effect of various parameters on the outcome of predator-prey interactions depends on whether the trade-offs affect the intrinsic growth rate or carrying capacity. In particular, coexistence is more likely when prey growth rate is affected by the evolving trait. In addition, in parameter regimes where cycles occur in both models, oscillations typically have larger periods and amplitudes when prey growth rate is affected by the evolving trait.  2018 Elsevier Ltd"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theoretical | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Predators are often assumed to have independent and additive effects on shared prey survival; however, multiple predator effects can be non-additive if predators foraging together reduce prey survival (risk enhancement) or increase prey survival through interference (risk reduction). In marine communities, juvenile reef fish experience very high mortality from two predator guilds with very different hunting modes and foraging domains-benthic and pelagic predator guilds. The few previous predator manipulation studies have found or assumed that mortality is independent and additive. We tested whether interacting predator guilds result in non-additive prey mortality and whether the detection of such effects change over time as prey are depleted. To do so, we examined the roles of benthic and pelagic predators on the survival of a juvenile shoaling zooplanktivorous temperate reef fish, Trachinops caudimaculatus, on artificial patch reefs over 2 months in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We observed risk enhancement in the first 7 days, as shoaling behaviour placed prey between predator foraging domains with no effective refuge. At day 14 we observed additive mortality, and risk enhancement was no longer detectable. By days 28 and 62, pelagic predators were no longer significant sources of mortality and additivity was trivial. We hypothesize that declines in prey density led to reduced shoaling behaviour that brought prey more often into the domain of benthic predators, resulting in limited mortality from pelagic predators. Furthermore, pelagic predators may have spent less time patrolling reefs in response to declines in prey numbers. Our observation of the changing interaction between predators and prey has important implications for assessing the role of predation in regulating populations in complex communities.  2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

However, in native forests Eucalyptus species often grow in mixtures. Mixed species stands of trees can be more productive than monospecific stands but despite the implications of this effect, for plantations and native Eucalyptus forests, the effects of mixing eucalypts has received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine whether two species that naturally coexist (Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill and Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.) grow faster in mixtures than their respective monocultures. Monocultures and 1:1 mixtures, and stands of two initial planting densities (1250 and 2500 trees ha -1), were used to compare the productivity and stand structures of mixtures and monocultures and to quantify inter- and intra-specific competition. Interactions between these Eucalyptus species increased their relative yields in mixtures by 10-30%. This was associated with changes in stand structure where the diameter distributions of both species became less positively skewed (lower proportions of small trees). Mixing effects were relatively consistent as the stands developed suggesting that if this complementarity effect is used in plantations there is considerable silvicultural flexibility, such that these mixed plantations could be used on both shorter rotations for biomass or pulp-logs as well as longer rotations for solid wood products. This study also suggests that interactions between co-occurring Eucalyptus species in natural forests might actually facilitate individual tree growth, in addition to simply enabling co-existence.  2012 Elsevier B.V."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

First, we found that herbivorous mites had a moderate negative effect on powdery mildew: when mites were absent, powdery mildew colonies were larger and more numerous. Second, we showed that each plant parasite, when evaluated alone, significantly reduced several measures of plant performance. Third, we found that the combined impact of mites and mildew on plant performance is mostly additive and, for a few variables, less than additive. Finally, we explored compensatory responses and found no evidence for nonlinearities in the relationship between plant performance and cumulative parasite impact.

In a factorial field experiment, cattle were excluded from half the subplots, and neighboring plants were removed from half the subplots. Transplants of each of the species were planted in plots on hillsides and in flat areas, and the entire experiment was replicated in two pastures. The effects of grazing were negative and were proportional to the ungrazed height of each species. In the absence of grazing and competition, the flat plots were more favorable than the hillside plots. Grazing reversed the relative favorableness of flat and hillside plots, most likely because grazing was more intense in the flat plots due to cattle preference for flatter ground. The removal of neighboring plants always had a positive effect, indicating competition from neighboring plants. The relative impact of competition from pre-existing plants was generally greater in the flat plots than in the hillside plots. The relative impacts of grazing were generally greater in the absence of competing plants, and the relative impacts of competition were generally greater in the absence of grazing. The most likely explanation for this antagonistic interaction between the effects of herbivory and competition is an indirect positive effect Of grazing that arose from a reduction in competition experienced by a target plant due to the defoliation of its neighbors. The results of this study, when combined with the known distributions of the six grass species in this region, indicate that herbivory, rather than competition or the physical environment, controls the distribution of at least five of the six species across the landscape. For example, Schizachyrium scoparium grew well in ungrazed flat subplots but verypoorly in grazed flat subplots; grazing, not the physical environment or competition, accounts for the absence of S. scoparium from most flat sites in this region. Competition modulates the effects of herbivory and edaphic factors on landscape distributions but does not control the distribution of any of the six species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Species that might, in theory, be able to shift rapidly enough to keep up with climate velocity (the rate and direction that isotherms move across the landscape) may not in actuality be able to do so when facing the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors. Despite empirical reports of substantial interactions between climate change and other stressors, we often lack a mechanistic understanding of these interactions. Here, we developed and analyzed a spatial population dynamics model to explore the cumulative impacts of climate with another dominant stressor in the ocean and on land: harvest. We found that critical rates of climate velocity and harvest depend on the growth rate and dispersal kernel of the population, as well as the magnitude of the other stressor. This allowed us to identify conditions under which harvesting and climate velocity can together drive populations extinct even when neither stressor would do so in isolation. Except in these extreme cases, we also found that the interaction between the declines in biomass caused by climate velocity and harvest is approximately additive. Finally, we have shown that threshold harvest rules can be effective management tools to mitigate the interaction between the two stressors, while protected areas can either help or hinder, depending on how harvesters reallocate their effort. We also have parameterized the model for black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) to demonstrate the model's broad applicability.

However, we know little about the overall trends of such responses, the GC drivers involved and the plant attributes affected. We synthesized literature to answer the question: Does soil heterogeneity significantly affect plant responses to main GC drivers, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO 2), nitrogen (N) enrichment and changes in rainfall regime? Overall, most studies have addressed short-term effects of N enrichment on the performance of model plant communities using experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The role of soil heterogeneity as a modulator of plant responses to elevated CO 2 may depend on the plasticity in nutrient uptake patterns. Soil heterogeneity does interact with N enrichment to determine plant growth and nutrient status, but the outcome of this interaction has been found to be both synergistic and inhibitory. The very few studies published on interactive effects of soil heterogeneity and changes in rainfall regime prevented us from identifying any general pattern. We identify the long-term consequences of soil heterogeneity on plant community dynamics in the field, and the ecosystem-level responses of the soil heterogeneity  GC driver interaction, as the main knowledge gaps in this area of research. To fill these gaps and take soil heterogeneity and GC research a step forward, we propose the following research guidelines: (i) combining morphological and physiological plant responses to soil heterogeneity with field observations of community composition and predictions from simulation models and (ii) incorporating soil heterogeneity into a trait-based response-effect framework, where plant-resource-use traits are used as both response variables to this heterogeneity and GC, and predictors of ecosystem functioning. Synthesis. There is enough evidence to affirm that soil heterogeneity modulates plant responses to elevated atmospheric CO 2 and N enrichment. Our synthesis indicates that we must explicitly consider soil heterogeneity to accurately predict plant responses to GC drivers.  2012 The Authors.

Xenostrobus securis is an invasive mussel species that is spreading in the inner part of the Galician Rias Baixas, particularly in areas of low salinity. It cooccurs with the commercially important blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in mixed patchy aggregations on intertidal shores. We asked whether biotic interactions, i.e. competition, facilitation and predation, could explain patterns of coexistence of the 2 species in an estuarine habitat. We also examined whether the effects of such interactions were dependent upon the environmental context. We manipulated predator access to synthetic aggregations of juvenile mussels at different sites using monospecific aggregations of X. securis and M. galloprovincialis and mixed aggregations at high and low densities. Performance of the species was measured as survivorship, growth and condition index. Predation played an important role in determining abundances of both species, especially in the case of the invader, although the effects on survivorship were context dependent. We did not find evidence of intra- or inter-specific competition. Growth rates of the invader were affected by environmental variability (i.e. significant site effect). Condition index of M. galloprovincialis improved in high density aggregations (monospecific and mixed), but only towards the sea (i.e. the outermost site). Results suggest that facilitative rather than competitive interactions contribute to the abundance patterns of the 2 species, at least during the juvenile stage.

Herbivory might limit plant functional responses to water shortage. This may occur as a result of plant resource depletion or due to the fact that leaf damage and drought may elicit opposite phenotypic responses. We evaluated the impact of herbivory on plant fitness in the field, and the effects of leaf damage on phenotypic plasticity to reduced soil moisture in a greenhouse. The study species was Convolvulus demissus, a perennial herb endemic to central Chile, which has a Mediterranean-type climate. Controlled herbivory by chrysomelid beetles (natural herbivores) in the field had a negative impact on plant fitness, estimated as number of fruits. Whereas reduced soil moisture alone did not affect seedling survival, damaged seedlings (simulated herbivory) had greater mortality when growing under water shortage. The hypothesis that herbivory would constrain phenotypic plasticity was supported by significant statistical interactions between leaf damage and soil moisture, followed by inspections of reaction norms. This was verified both overall (allphenotypic traits taken together, MANOVA) and in four of the six traits evaluated (ANOVAs). Whenplants were damaged, the reaction norms in response to low soil moisture of water use efficiency, root:shoot ratio and xylem water potential showed reduced slopes. While undamaged plants increased root biomass in response to low moisture, the opposite trend was found for damaged plants. The simultaneous occurrence of herbivory and drought events might curtail recruitment in plant populations of central Chile and other Mediterranean-type ecosystems due to the inability of damaged seedlings to show functional responses to low soil moisture. This finding is of ecological significance in view of current and projected trends of increased aridity in these ecosystems.  2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herbivores, however, can alter vegetation structure and reduce diversity when abundant. Herbivores may act on mature, reproductive life stages whereas some of the strongest competitive effects might occur at early life stages that are difficult to observe. For example, competition by perennial nonnative grasses can interfere with the establishment of native seeds. We contrasted the effects of ungulate herbivory and competition by neighboring plants on the performance of native plant species at early and established life stages in invaded oak meadows. We recorded growth, survival, and flowering in two native species transplanted as established plants, six native species grown from seed, and five extant lily species as part of two 2  2 factorial experiments that manipulated herbivory and competition. Herbivory reduced the performance of nearly all focal native species at early and established life stages, whereas competition had few measurable effects.

Females length at maturity, somatic dry mass, reproductive allotment and fecundity varied significantly among predation sites. Phalloceros harpagos from the high-predation site showed smaller size at maturity and somatic dry mass, greater reproductive allotment and higher fecundity than the nonpredation site. In all sites, we observed superfetation: pregnant females with two broods at different developmental stages. The presence of superfetation was not observed before in other congeneric species, and it may represent an additional independent evolutionary origin of superfetation in the fish family Poeciliidae. Matrotrophy, the postfertilisation maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing embryos throughout gestation, was observed in all three sites, with values of the matrotrophy index above two. The population under high predation pressure showed the highest degree of matrotrophy (embryos quadruplicate their dry mass during development) and the greatest percentage of females with superfetation (44.4%). Some life history traits responded more strongly to predators presence and others to predator density. These results suggest that different predation regimes shape female life history traits, increasing fecundity in high-predation sites. The results also suggest a link between the cost of reproduction and the evolution of matrotrophy and superfetation, potentially to reduce the risk of predation without reducing fecundity.  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In invaded communities, these parameters might be difficult to predict because ecological relationships are typically evolutionarily novel. We examined feeding rates and preferences of a crab native to the Pacific Northwest, Cancer productus, among four prey items: two invasive species of oyster drill (the marine whelks Urosalpinx cinerea and Ocenebra inornata) and two species of oyster (Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea lurida) that are also consumed by U. cinerea and O. inornata. This system is also characterized by intraguild predation because crabs are predators of drills and compete with them for prey (oysters). When only the oysters were offered, crabs did not express a preference and consumed approximately 9 juvenile oysters crab-1 day-1. We then tested whether crabs preferred adult drills of either U. cinerea or O. inornata, or juvenile oysters (C. gigas). While crabs consumed drills and oysters at approximately the same rate when only one type of prey was offered, they expressed a strong preference for juvenile oysters over drills when they were allowed to choose among the three prey items. This preference for oysters might negate the positive indirect effects that crabs have on oysters by crabs consuming drills (trophic cascade) because crabs have a large negative direct effect on oysters when crabs, oysters, and drills co-occur.  2012 Grason, Miner."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We explored the interaction effects of fishing, ocean warming, and ocean acidification over time on 60 functional groups of species in the southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic (amplified stress), additive (no additional stress), or antagonistic (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size, direction, and type of interaction effect varied depending on the combination of stressors. Top predator and fish biomass had a synergistic response to the interaction of all three stressors, whereas biomass of benthic invertebrates responded antagonistically.

We devised a novel approach to identify such species. We constructed annual interaction-effect networks (IENs) of the simulated changes in biomass between species of the southeastern Australian marine system. Each annual IEN was composed of the species linked by either an additive (sum of the individual stressor response), synergistic (lower biomass compared with additive effects), or antagonistic (greater biomass compared with additive effects) response to the interaction effect of ocean warming, ocean acidification, and fisheries. Structurally, over the simulation period, the number of species and links in the synergistic IENs increased and the network structure became more stable. The stability of the antagonistic IENs decreased and became more vulnerable to the loss of species. In contrast, there was no change in the structural attributes of species linked by an additive response. Using indices common in food-web and network theory, we identified the species in each IEN for which a change in biomass from stressor effects would disproportionately affect the biomass of other species via direct and indirect local, intermediate, and global predatorprey feeding interactions.

Four native tree species were planted in old field and forest experimental plots: Castanea dentata (American chestnut), Quercus rubra (red oak), Acer saccharum (sugar maple), and Picea rubens (red spruce). Red spruce demonstrated the highest growth increment and greatest survival (64%) and most consistent results among treatments and habitats. Red spruce survival was not reduced in the presence of Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) browse and herbaceous competition; however, growth was improved by suppression of herbaceous competition. We suspect that this deciduous forest landscape would regenerate to a red spruce dominated forest if seed source was available. In contrast, the other three species tested had very low survival when exposed to deer and were more responsive to competing vegetation and habitat type. American chestnut had low survival and growth across all treatments, suggesting basic climate limitations.

Ecological theory, individual experiments in many different systems, and system-specific quantitative reviews have suggested that (i) bottom-up control is pervasive but top-down control is more influential in aquatic habitats relative to terrestrial systems and (ii) bottom-up and top-down forces are interdependent, with statistical interactions that synergize or dampen relative influences on producer biomass. We used simple dynamic models to review ecological mechanisms that generate independent vs. interactive responses of community-level biomass. We calibrated these mechanistic predictions with the metrics of factorial meta-analysis and tested their prevalence across freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 191 factorial manipulations of herbivores and nutrients. Our analysis showed that producer community biomass increased with fertilization across all systems, although increases were greatest in freshwater habitats. Herbivore removal generally increased producer biomass in both freshwater and marine systems, but effects were inconsistent on land. With the exception of marine temperate rocky reef systems that showed positive synergism of nutrient enrichment and herbivore removal, experimental studies showed limited support for statistical interactions between nutrient and herbivory treatments on producer biomass. Top-down control of herbivores, compensatory behaviour of multiple herbivore guilds, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of interactions, and herbivore-mediated nutrient recycling may lower the probability of consistent interactive effects on producer biomass. Continuing studies should expand the temporal and spatial scales of experiments, particularly in understudied terrestrial systems; broaden factorial designs to manipulate independently multiple producer resources (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, light), multiple herbivore taxa or guilds (e.g. vertebrates and invertebrates) and multiple trophic levels; and - in addition to measuring producer biomass - assess the responses of species diversity, community composition and nutrient status.  2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

The first category includes natural vegetation diverting herbivores away from crop plants, which appears to be the most beneficial effect, but this is sensitive to the spatial scales at which herbivores forage. There is little evidence that mechanisms in the second category significantly affect crop performance. The viability of crops is critically dependent on the dynamics of plant-plant interactions (the third category) and their interactions with associational effects.

When effects were present, neighbouring vegetation reduced plant growth and survival, and insect herbivores decreased relative biomass allocation to roots and increased plant mortality. 4 Although reduced herbivory caused by insecticide application had little direct effects on plant biomass, it did interact with competition to affect growth for three of the four species. Herbivory reduced the strength of competition experienced by Coreopsis, but increased it in Linum. For both Coreopsis and Helianthus, the combined effects of herbivory and competition on plant growth were less than expected from a simple multiplicative response. 5 We suggest that interactions were found because we used an experimental design that modified insect densities on both neighbours and the focal plant, allowing for determination of both direct and indirect effects. 6 We suggest that the antagonistic interactions between competition and herbivory may have occurred because herbivores altered the competitive environment by harming the neighbouring plants, or because the presence of neighbours facilitated focal plant growth by distributing herbivore loads over the greater amount of plant biomass available. 7 Although as an isolated factor competition is more intense in this system than insect herbivory, herbivory can alter the strength of competitive interactions and thus its importance cannot be determined by measuring intensity alone. This result emphasizes that these two ecological processes are not truly discrete, and further suggests that studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple ecological processes are needed."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Animals often respond behaviorally to environmental change, and multiple stressors can have both population-level and community-level effects. However, the individual, not combined, effects of stressors on animal behavior are commonly studied. There is a need to understand how animals respond to the more complex combinations of stressors that occur in nature, which requires a systematic and rigorous approach to quantify the various potential behavioral responses to the independent and interactive effects of stressors. We illustrate a robust, systematic approach for understanding behavioral responses to multiple stressors based on integrating schemes used to quantitatively classify interactions in multiple-stressor research and to qualitatively view interactions between multiple stimuli in behavioral experiments. We introduce and unify the two frameworks, highlighting their conceptual and methodological similarities, and use four case studies to demonstrate how this unification could improve our interpretation of interactions in behavioral experiments and guide efforts to manage the effects of multiple stressors. Our unified approach: (1) provides behavioral ecologists with a more rigorous and systematic way to quantify how animals respond to interactions between multiple stimuli, an important theoretical advance, (2) helps us better understand how animals behave when they encounter multiple, potentially interacting stressors, and (3) contributes more generally to the understanding of ecological surprises in multiple stressors research.  2016 The Authors.

This study compared the relative and interacting effects of competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for juvenile coral reef fishes.  2016 Hall, Kingsford.

Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence of a biased choice of study systems, where studies using the first approach have primarily studied mammalian herbivory while studies using the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory. Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very small-scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of removal experiments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

In the absence of herbivores, sticky and velvety plants grew to similar sizes in their first year, but sticky plants grew larger in the second and third years. Seed production of sticky plants was 46-60% less than velvety plants in their first year, and this caused a 13% reduction in their finite rate of increase overall, even though sticky plants produced more seeds than velvety plants did in later years. The impact of herbivory varied with plant density, and herbivores reduced plant fitness more at low plant density than at high plant density.

Using a meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation and combination. As expected biological responses varied across taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change experiments that incorporate interactions.

These differences appear to be the result of variation in early population growth rate between the pea aphid clones, rather than predation, although predation did lead to the eventual extinction of colonies. We also questioned whether intra- and interspecific differences in predator escape behaviour could affect the outcome of competition in the field. All three clones responded similarly to the presence of foraging hoverfly larvae (Episyrphus balteatus), but the Megoura viciae clone dropped from the plant significantly less often in response to the presence of a foraging two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata). This work provides evidence that intraspecific variation in competitive ability can alter the outcome of interspecific competitive interactions in nature and suggests that species-specific behavioural traits may have the potential to modify the outcome of these interactions.  2005 Gesellschaft fr kologie."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Intra-specific variation in plant defence traits has been shown to profoundly affect herbivore community structure. Here we describe two experiments designed to test whether similar effects occur at higher trophic levels, by studying pea aphid-natural enemy interactions in a disused pasture in southern England. 2. In the first experiment, the numbers and identity of natural enemies attacking different monoclonal pea aphid colonies were recorded in a series of assays throughout the period of pea aphid activity. 3. In the summer assay, there was a significant effect of clone on the numbers of aphidophagous hoverfly larvae and the total number of non-hoverfly natural enemies recruited. Clone also appeared to influence the attack rate suffered by the primary predator in the system, the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, by Diplazon laetatorius, an ichneumonid parasitoid. Colonies were generally driven to extinction by hoverfly attack, resulting in the recording of low numbers of parasitoids and entomopathogens, suggesting intense intra-guild predation. 4. To further examine the influence of clonal variation on the recruitment of natural enemies, a second experiment was performed to monitor the temporal dynamics of community development. Colonies were destructively sampled every other day and the numbers of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies were recorded. These data demonstrated that clonal variation influenced the timing, abundance, and identity of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies. 5. Taken together, these data suggest that clonal variation may have a significant influence on the patterns of interactions between aphids and their natural enemies, and that such effects are likely to affect our understanding of the ecology and biological control of these insect herbivores.  2008 The Authors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We provide a global synthesis of consumer control of vegetation in coastal wetlands, where the domineering role of physical factors such as nutrient and salinity, rather than consumers, has been emphasized for decades. Using a data set of 1748 measures of consumer effects reported in 443 experiments/ observations on all continents except Antarctica, we examine the generality of consumer control in salt marshes and mangroves globally. Our analyses show that salt marsh herbivores, including insects, snails, crabs, waterfowl, small mammals, and livestock, generally and often strongly suppress plant survival, aboveground biomass, and height, while their effects on plant density, belowground biomass, reproduction, and cover are more variable. These effects occur in forbs, grasses, and shrubs, and in both seedlings and adult plants. Herbivores additionally affect plant nutrient stoichiometry, and mediate plant interactions, though their effects on plant diversity are less consistent. Higher trophic levels also affect plants, as predators facilitate plant growth through trophic cascades that suppress grazer abundance and grazing rate. In mangroves, there are also signs of consumer control, though the relatively few studies available have often focused on mangrove propagules and seedlings rather than adults. Our analyses further reveal that the strength of consumer control is regulated by many physical factors. Nutrient, disturbance, and flooding, for example, amplify the negative effects of herbivores. Along latitudinal gradients, increased temperature enhances the negative effects of ectothermic herbivores, but has no effect on those of endothermic herbivores. Consumer control of coastal plants is also apparent across study methodologies: in field and laboratory settings, in observational studies, in consumer exclusion and addition experiments, in natural and transplanted plants, and in experiments of various durations. The role of consumer control in coastal vegetation worldwide highlights the need to better recognize and theoretically conceptualize both top-down and bottom-up forcing and their interactions in coastal wetlands. Improved understanding and conservation of coastal wetlands will only occur if we incorporate what the science has revealed: Trophic feedbacks are an important and pervasive determinant of coastal plant communities.  2016 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

We found that natives and exotics exhibit pronounced asymmetries, as exotics are competitively superior to natives, but are more significantly impacted by herbivores. We also found that herbivore removal mediated the outcome of competitive interactions and altered patterns of dominance across our field sites.

Analyses of individual size in five unpalatable forest plant species in long-term experimental paired deer exclosure/deer access plots corroborate the natural site results; all five species were smaller in deer access plots. Analyses of abiotic variables in natural and experimental sites suggest one potential mechanism for indirect effects of deer. Deer-mediated soil quality declines included increased soil penetration resistance and decreased leaf litter depth, which are known to hinder plant growth. Our results are likely applicable to other unpalatable forest species and have clear consequences for understory biodiversity.

Although robbing can reduce plant reproductive success, many studies fail to find such effects. We outline three mechanistic hypotheses that can explain when interactions between plants and nectar-robbers should be commensal rather than antagonistic: the non-discrimination (pollinators do not avoid robbed flowers), visitor prevalence (robber visitation is rare relative to pollinator visitation), and pollen saturation (stigmas receive sufficient pollen to fertilize all ovules with one or very few pollinator visits) hypotheses. We then explore these mechanisms in the North American subalpine, bumble bee-pollinated and nectar-robbed plant Corydalis caseana (Fumariaceae). We first confirmed that the effects of nectar robbing on female reproductive success were neutral in C. caseana. We then tested the three mechanisms underlying these neutral effects using a combination of observational studies and experiments. We found evidence for all three mechanisms. First, consistent with the non-discrimination hypothesis, pollinators failed to discriminate against experimentally robbed flowers or inflorescences even though naturally robbed flowers offered significantly lower nectar rewards than unrobbed flowers. Second, C. caseana was more commonly visited by pollinators than by nectar robbers, in accordance with the visitor prevalence hypothesis. Third, stigmas of unvisited flowers as well as those visited once by pollinators were saturated with pollen, with all stigmas bearing pollen loads several orders of magnitude higher than the number of ovules per fruit, consistent with the pollen saturation hypothesis. Our investigation of the mechanisms driving the commensal outcome of nectar robbing in this system deepens our understanding of the ecology of nectar robbing and contributes to a more general understanding of the variation in the outcomes of interactions between species.  2018 The Authors"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Focusing on red and arctic fox in tundra with cyclic populations of rodents as key prey, we develop a model to predict how population dynamics of a dominant and versatile predator (red fox) impacted long-term growth rate of a subdominant and less versatile predator (arctic fox). We compare three realistic scenarios of red fox performance: (1) a numerical response scenario where red fox acted as a resident rodent specialist exhibiting population cycles lagging one year after the rodent cycle, (2) an aggregative response scenario where red fox shifted between tundra and a nearby ecosystem (i.e. boreal forest) so as to track rodent peaks in tundra without delay, and (3) a constant subsidy scenario in which the red fox population was stabilized at the same mean density as in the other two scenarios. For all three scenarios it is assumed that the arctic fox responded numerically as a rodent specialist and that the mechanisms of competition is of a interference type for space, in which the arctic fox is excluded from the most resource rich patches in tundra. Arctic fox is impacted most by the constant subsidy scenario and least by the numerical response scenario. The differential effects of the scenarios stemmed from cyclic phase-dependent sensitivity to competition mediated by changes in temporal mean and variance of available prey to the subdominant predator. A general implication from our result is that external resource subsidies (prey or habitats), monopolized by the dominant competitor, can significantly reduce the likelihood for co-existence within the predator guild. In terms of conservation of vulnerable arctic fox populations this means that the likelihood of extinction increases with increasing amount of subsidies (e.g. carcasses of large herbivores or marine resources) in tundra and nearby forest areas, since it will act to both increase and stabilize populations of red fox.  2009 Oikos."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theoretical | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Statistical autoregressive analyses of direct and delayed density dependence are widespread in ecological research. The models suggest that changes in ecological factors affecting density dependence, like predation and landscape heterogeneity are directly portrayed in the first and second order autoregressive parameters, and the models are therefore used to decipher complex biological patterns. However, independent tests of model predictions are complicated by the inherent variability of natural populations, where differences in landscape structure, climate or species composition prevent controlled repeated analyses. To circumvent this problem, we applied second-order autoregressive time series analyses to data generated by a realistic agent-based computer model. The model simulated life history decisions of individual field voles under controlled variations in predator pressure and landscape fragmentation. Analyses were made on three levels: comparisons between predated and non-predated populations, between populations exposed to different types of predators and between populations experiencing different degrees of habitat fragmentation. Results. The results are unambiguous: Changes in landscape fragmentation and the numerical response of predators are clearly portrayed in the statistical time series structure as predicted by the autoregressive model. Populations without predators displayed significantly stronger negative direct density dependence than did those exposed to predators, where direct density dependence was only moderately negative. The effects of predation versus no predation had an even stronger effect on the delayed density dependence of the simulated prey populations. In non-predated prey populations, the coefficients of delayed density dependence were distinctly positive, whereas they were negative in predated populations. Similarly, increasing the degree of fragmentation of optimal habitat available to the prey was accompanied with a shift in the delayed density dependence, from strongly negative to gradually becoming less negative. Conclusion. We conclude that statistical second-order autoregressive time series analyses are capable of deciphering interactions within and across trophic levels and their effect on direct and delayed density dependence.  2009 Hendrichsen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

In natural communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions. Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies. Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence. Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim. We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids. The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent competition. Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in insect communities through modifying species interactions. This highlights the need for experimental data when studying species coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.

(ii) Which environmental variables affect the degree of grazer control? (iii) How much does the result of these experiments depend on facets of experimental design? Across all ecosystems, the grazers removed on average 59% of the periphyton biomass, with grazing being significantly stronger for laboratory (65%) than for field (56%) experiments. Neither field nor lab experiments showed a significant difference among lotic, lentic, and coastal habitats. Among different taxonomic consumer groups, crustaceans (amphipods and isopods) and trichopteran larvae removed the highest proportion of periphyton biomass. Grazer effects increased with increasing algal biomass, with decreasing resource availability and with increasing temperature, especially in field experiments. Grazer effects also increased with increasing total grazer biomass in field experiments but showed the opposite trend in lab experiments, indicating a tendency toward overcrowded lab experiments.

The relative impact of both of these factors, and their interactions, on periphyton biomass were examined in a quantitative meta-analysis. A literature survey revealed 85 experiments with factorial and replicated manipulation of grazer access and nutrient supply. Two measures of effect sizes were calculated for each experiment, one based on final biomass yields (Hedges' d) and the other on rates (r). Grazers significantly reduced periphyton biomass across all experiments, whereas nutrient addition significantly increased periphyton biomass. Effect sizes were very large for both factors. Thus, periphyton can be viewed as highly controlled by top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Grazer effects were greater than nutrient effects. This result would be expected because nutrient enrichment represents a relative relief from nutrient limitation, whereas grazer exclusion represents a categorical removal of grazing pressure. Moreover, nutrient uptake and growth response are time-lagged, whereas grazer effects are more immediate. The assembled data set was used to test for significant impacts of the habitat and of the experimental design on the importance of grazers and nutrients. Both factors had consistent effects in streams, lakes, and coastal environments, although some variation in effect strength was found. Background productivity levels also did not affect the main effects, but increases in periphyton biomass led to increasing grazer effects and decreasing nutrient effects. The interaction between grazing and nutrients differed between habitats from different aquatic realms and with different productivity. The interaction metric for Hedges' d was significantly positive for lakes and coasts, indicating a greater impact of nutrients in the absence of herbivores than in their presence. No such interaction was found for streams or for mesotrophic habitats. Similar trends were evident for r. The experimental design profoundly affected the effects of grazers and nutrients on periphyton biomass, with regard to type of grazer manipulation, type of nutrient enrichment, and duration of the experiment. This outcome indicated the crucial role of a careful experimental design."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Most studies on top-down vs. bottom-up control of plant biomass focus on nutrients as basal resources, whereas light has received considerably less attention. 2 Effects of light and nutrients may differ because light represents a vertical resource and plant adaptations to acquire light might counteract or facilitate consumer effects. I tested the interaction between light supply and consumer presence in a meta-analysis of experiments that manipulated both these factors factorially and measured the biomass of benthic algae (periphyton). 3 Both grazer removal and light enhancement had positive effects on algal biomass. These two factors showed strong interactions, which exceeded previously observed interaction terms between nutrient supply and grazer removal. Positive light effects on algal biomass were primarily observed in the absence of grazers. Grazer effects became stronger at high light supply, which indicated that high light favours algal growth types that are easily ingested. 4 Further analyses showed that light effects increased with trophic state of the habitat and with algal biomass, indicating enhanced importance of light limitation and self-shading at high nutrient supply. Grazer effects depended on grazer biomass and varied with type of experimental manipulation. 5 This study implies that light is of similar importance as nutrients in resource control of benthic algal biomass. High light levels simultaneously enhance consumer control of algal biomass, resulting in strong resource vs. consumer interactions. Light competition and consumer presence pose a trade-off on algal growth, where growth form may distinguish between adaptations to acquire light and to avoid consumption.  2005 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

A tractable experimental design to determine such effects and their interactions for demersal (seafloor oriented) fishes and similar sedentary species is cross-factoring multiple densities of new recruits with the presence and absence of predators. This design allows one to distinguish between density-dependent mortality due to competition alone, predation alone, or an interaction between the two, especially when supplemental field observations are available. To date, 14 species of marine fish have been examined with some variant of this design, and for 12 species predation was demonstrated to be the sole or major cause of density dependence. However, as competition may be slow acting relative to predation, the importance of competition can be underestimated in short-term experiments. On the Great Barrier Reef, we conducted a long-term field experiment in which multiple densities of new recruits of a planktivorous damselfish were cross-factored with the presence or absence of resident piscivorous fish on patch reefs. During the first 10 months, no density-dependent mortality was detected, regardless of whether resident predators were present or absent. By the end of the experiment at 17 months, per capita mortality was strongly density dependent and highly compensatory in both predator treatments; all reefs ultimately supported nearly the same adult density regardless of experimental treatment. Examination of treatment effect sizes suggested that competition was the main source of density-dependent mortality, with predation being merely a proximate agent of death. We hypothesize that predators were ineffective in this system compared with similar studies elsewhere because prey density was low relative to ample prey refuges provided by highly complex corals. Combined with previous studies, these findings indicate that density-dependent mortality in demersal marine fishes is often caused by interplay of predation and competition, whose roles may be altered by variation in habitat complexity and larval supply. These conclusions are relevant to marine fisheries models, which typically assume that density dependence is due solely to intraspecific competition.  2005 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The competitors are two damselfishes, three-spot dascyllus (Dascyllus trimaculatus) and orange-fin anemonefish (Amphiprion chrysopterus), that vie for shelter space on a sea anemone (Heteractis magnified). Anemonefish have an indirect positive effect on dascyllus populations due to the faster growth that anemones experience when they are occupied by Amphiprion. A long-term experiment revealed that anemonefish depressed dascyllus density (number of individuals per area of anemone per area of reef) more than abundance (number of individuals per reef area) because anemonefish caused a greater net increase in anemone surface area. We calculated that the effect of competition alone would depress dascyllus populations to near zero. The indirect positive interaction compensated for 67% of the direct negative effect. Failure to consider the indirect positive interaction in this system would lead to a gross underestimate of the strength of competition, and would not reveal the critical importance of the indirect mutualism in maintaining local populations of the inferior competitor.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the UK as a case study, we use meta-analytical approach to review the available evidence to assess the effect of vertebrate predation on animal prey abundance. We find a significant effect of predators on prey abundance across our studies. On average, there is a 1.6 fold increase in prey abundance in the absence of predation. However, we show significant heterogeneity effect sizes, and discuss how the method of predator control, whether the predator is native or non-native, and aspects of study design, may be potential causes. Conclusions/Significance: Our results allow some cautious policy recommendations to be made regarding the management of predator and prey populations. Meta-analysis is an important tool for understanding general patterns in the effect of predators on prey abundance across studies.

Separate analyses were performed for each life-history stage: seedlings, juveniles; pre-reproductives and reproductives, for a total of 55 analyses. Emergent patterns for stages were evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining years. To determine significance of effects in single years, we calculated table-wide probabilities for each stage across multiple years (Bonferroni sequential test). Emergent patterns for years were also evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining stages. 3. Survival of seedlings was positively affected by plant size and negatively affected by local competition. Survival of juveniles was positively affected by plant size, but not by other factors. Survival of large stages was not generally affected by any of the factors. 4. Relative growth rates of all stages were negatively affected by plant size; larger plants grew more slowly than smaller plants. Additionally, growth rate of juveniles was negatively affected by local competition, whereas growth rate of reproductives was positively affected by reproduction. 5. Next year's inflorescence production was positively affected by plant size for both pre-reproductive and reproductive stages. For reproductives, it was additionally positively affected by current fruit production. 6 Analysis of differences among years showed that herbivory negatively affected both survival and growth in 1985, but not in other years, whereas local competition negatively affected survival in 1983 and growth in 1984. 7. Effects of biotic interactions varied among stages and through time.

Using the freshwater snail Helisoma trivolvis and two common predators (water bugs Belostoma flumineum and crayfish Orconectes rusticus), we explored how prey integrate information along multiple predation risk gradients (i.e. caged predators fed increasing amounts of prey biomass) that induce opposing phenotypes. When exposed to single predators fed increasing amounts of prey biomass, we detected threshold responses; intermediate amounts of consumed biomass induced phenotypic responses, but higher amounts induced little additional induction. This suggests that additional increases in predator-induced traits with greater predator risk offer minimal increases in fitness or that a limit in the response magnitude was reached. Additionally, the response thresholds were contingent on the predator and focal trait. For shell width, responses were generally detected at a lower amount of consumed biomass by water bugs compared to crayfish. Within the crayfish treatments, we found that the shell thickness response threshold was lower than the shell width response threshold. When we combined gradients of consumed biomass from both predators, we found that the magnitude of response to one predator was often reduced when the other predator was present. Interestingly, these effects were often detected at consumed biomass levels that were lower than the threshold concentration necessary to elicit a response in the single-predator treatments. Moreover, our combined predator treatments revealed that snails shifted from discrete responses to more continuous (i.e. graded) responses. Together, our results reveal that organisms experiencing multiple environmental gradients can integrate this information to make phenotypic decisions and demonstrate the novel result that an exposure to multiple species of predators can lower the response threshold of prey.  2016 Nordic Society Oikos."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We examined these processes in and among populations of field voles, sibling voles, bank voles and common shrews in western Finland, using spatially replicated trapping data collected four times a year during two vole cycles (1987-1990 and 1997-1999). Populations of the four species exhibited relatively strong interspecific temporal synchrony in their multiannual fluctuations. During peak phases, we observed slight deviations from close temporal synchrony: field vole densities peaked at least two months earlier than those of either sibling voles or bank voles, while densities of common shrews peaked even earlier. The growth rates of all four coexisting small mammal species were best explained by their own current densities. The growth rate of bank vole populations was negatively related to increasing densities of field voles in the increase phase of the vole cycle. Apart from this, no negative effects of interspecific density, direct or delayed, were observed among the vole species. The growth rates of common shrew populations were negatively related to increasing total rodent (including water voles and harvest mice) densities in the peak phase of the vole cycle. Sibling voles appeared not to be competitively superior to field voles on a population level, as neither of these Microtus voles increased disproportionately in abundance as total rodent density increased. We suggest that interspecific competition among the vole species may occur, but only briefly, during the autumn of peak years, when the total available amount of rodent habitat becomes markedly reduced following agricultural practices. Our results nonetheless indicate that interspecific competition is not a strong determinant of the structure of communities comprised of species exhibiting cyclic dynamics. We suggest that external factors, namely predation and shortage of food, limit densities of vole populations below levels where interspecific competition occurs. Common shrews, however, appear to suffer from asymmetric space competition with rodents at peak densities of voles; this may be viewed as a synchronizing effect."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Here we studied mechanisms behind coexistence and shifts in competitive dominance in a size-structured fish guild, representing sprat and herring stocks in the Baltic Sea, using a physiologically structured model of competing populations. The influence of degree of resource overlap and the possibility of undergoing ontogenetic diet shifts were studied as functions of zooplankton and zoobenthos productivity. By imposing different size-dependent mortalities, we could study the outcome of competition under contrasting environmental regimes representing poor and favorable growth conditions. We found that the identity of the dominant species shifted between low and high productivity. Adding a herring-exclusive benthos resource only provided a competitive advantage over sprat when size-dependent mortality was high enough to allow for rapid growth in the zooplankton niche. Hence, the importance of a bottom-up effect of varying productivity was dependent on a strong top-down effect. Although herring could depress shared resources to lower levels than could sprat and also could access an exclusive resource, the smaller size at maturation of sprat allowed it to coexist with herring and, in some cases, exclude it. Our model system, characterized by interactions among size cohorts, allowed for consumer coexistence even at full resource overlap at intermediate productivities when size-dependent mortality was low. Observed shifts in community patterns were crucially dependent on the explicit consideration of size- and food-dependent growth. Accordingly, we argue that accounting for fooddependent growth and size-dependent interactions is necessary to better predict changes in community structure and dynamics following changes in major ecosystem drivers such as resource productivity and mortality, which are fundamental for our ability to manage exploitation of living resources in, e.g., fisheries.  2012 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theoretical | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

""Immigrant inviability,"" a barrier that arises from selection against immigrants in their nonnative environment, appears to be of particular importance. Although immigrant inviability is likely ubiquitous, we know relatively little about how selection acts on traits to drive immigrant inviability, and how important immigrant inviability is at early-versus-late stages of divergence. We present a study evaluating the role of predation in the evolution of immigrant inviability in recently diverged population pairs and a well-established species pair of Brachyrhaphis fishes. We evaluate performance in a high-predation environment by assessing survival in the presence of a predator, and swimming endurance in a low-predation environment. We find strong signatures of local adaptation and immigrant inviability of roughly the same magnitude both early and late in divergence. We find remarkably conserved selection for burst-speed swimming (important in predator evasion), and selection for increased size in low-predation environments.

Here, we examine interactions among two pairs of invasive crayfish species because of their close proximity and thus chance of sympatric populations in the near future within the Thames catchment, U.K. (signal, Pacifastacus leniusculus and virile crayfish, Orconectes virilis within a river system; red swamp, Procambarus clarkii and Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus found within a suite of ponds). We address two questions: do sympatric invasive crayfish occupy a smaller niche than their allopatric counterparts due to potential resource competition? and do interactions among invasive species amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on the ecosystem? Two fully factorial mesocosm experiments (one for each crayfish pair) were used to investigate crayfish diet and their impact on benthic invertebrate community structure, benthic algal standing stock and leaf litter decomposition rates in allopatric and sympatric populations, compared with a crayfish-free control. We used stable isotope analysis to examine crayfish diet in the mesocosms and in allopatric populations of each species in the Thames catchment. Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the invaders can coexist. All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades. Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively. Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry. Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their independent impacts.

As integrators of local catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41%) than synergistic (28%), additive (16%) or reversed (15%). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and co-adaptation to multiple stressors.  2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Although these two factors are often studied separately, they do not operate independently. We examined how aboveground herbivory by beet armyworm larvae (Spodoptera exigua) and belowground herbivory by wireworms (Agriotes lineatus) influenced competition between the plant species Jacobaea vulgaris and Leucanthemum vulgare exposed to three competition levels (no, intra-, and interspecific competition). In addition, we studied the effects of herbivory and competition on pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) concentrations in leaves of J. vulgaris. For J. vulgaris, aboveground herbivory significantly reduced shoot biomass while belowground herbivory increased root biomass. Biomass of L. vulgare was not affected by herbivory. Competition caused a reduction in biomass for both plant species, but herbivory did not affect the outcome of the competition. However, competition significantly influenced the amount of leaf damage experienced by the plants. A L. vulgare plant had significantly less damage from aboveground herbivores when grown together with J. vulgaris than when grown alone or in intraspecific competition, while a J. vulgaris plant experienced lowest damage in conditions of intraspecific competition. The total PA concentration in J. vulgaris leaves was highest for plants exposed to interspecific competition. Root herbivory caused an increase in the relative concentration of N-oxides, the less toxic form of PAs, in leaves of plants that were grown without competition, but a decrease in plants exposed to competition. Our study shows that competition and herbivory but also the type of competition and whether herbivory occurs above- or belowground, all influence plant performance.

For mosquitoes, most such experiments have focused on invasive Aedes albopictus and its interactions with resident Aedes. A meta-analysis of such experiments tested whether the effect of interspecific competition is greater than, less than, or equal to that of intraspecific competition, and whether competitive outcomes are dependent on food quality. For A. albopictus and A. aegypti, there was significant context dependence, with interspecific competitive advantage for A. albopictus with low food quality, and competitive equivalence with high food quality. Meta-analysis of survivorship yielded more significant effects than did estimated rate of increase. Competitive effects and competitive responses of each species yielded similar results. This meta-analysis suggests competitive exclusion of A. aegypti by A. albopictus, and is thus consistent with field sampling, qualitative reviews, and interpretations from individual publications. For A. albopictus and A. triseriatus, most results indicated competitive equivalence and no context dependence, and are thus contrary to previous qualitative reviews and to interpretations from individual publications. For both pairs of species, published results suitable for meta-analysis remain scarce, and better experimental designs and improved analysis and reporting of statistical results are needed. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on estimating species' inter- and intraspecific competitive effects, rather than the more common, but theoretically less interesting, competitive responses.

Thus, it is imperative to understand which factors determine where a particular interspecific interaction falls along the continuum. Over the past 20 years research on the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis has resulted in sufficient independent studies to now generalize about the factors and mechanisms that affect host response to ectomycorrhizas. Using meta-analysis we quantitatively evaluated the role of biotic (partner identity and colonization levels of ectomycorrhizal fungi) and abiotic (phosphorus levels) factors in determining host biomass, height, and shoot : root responses to ectomycorrhizal associations. On average, seedlings across multiple host genera increased in total biomass when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi regardless of the identity of the fungal associate; host genera differed in the magnitude of response for both total biomass and shoot : root ratio. Association with different fungal genera modified only host allocation of biomass to shoots and roots. Neither level of colonization on inoculated seedlings nor the level of contamination on control seedlings relative to colonization levels by target fungi on inoculated seedlings was important in explaining variation in effect sizes for any growth response. None of our proposed factors (identity of partners, colonization level, magnitude of contamination, or duration of association) explained variation in effect sizes for shoot height, although in general seedlings were taller when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Phosphorus additions did not influence effect sizes. Although the general trend across studies was for a positive response of hosts to ectomycorrhizal inoculation, publication bias and methodological issues effectively reduce and distort the spectrum on which we evaluate host responses to ectomycorrhizal inoculation. Our results indicate that the variation in ectomycorrhizal fungi perceived by the host may be of a discrete (presence/absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi) rather than continuous nature (variation in identity or abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi).  2008 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

This study used predator-exclusion cages and neighbour removals in a field experiment to test how indirect interactions between populations of three coral taxa, Acropora, Pocillopora, and Porites, influenced their survival during an outbreak of the crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, in Moorea, French Polynesia. High densities of corals enhanced survival by generating associational refuges: physical structures that impeded Acanthaster and protected corals, and by simple density-dependent prey dilution that reduced predation rates. Acanthaster showed feeding preferences, resulting in varying intensities of predation on corals, which (1) influenced the type and strength of the associational refuge among corals and (2) resulted in significant loss of the competitive dominants to the benefit of the competitive inferiors. The result was a set of indirect positive interactions (IPIs) that prevented Acanthaster from eradicating Acropora and may have enhanced Porites, a relatively weak competitor among corals. IPIs probably play a key role in many ecosystems, especially in coral reefs in which corals act as engineer species, to reduce impacts of perturbations and enhance community resilience.

In total, 58, 24 and 27 species of molluscs were found in samples from Australia, Ireland and Chile, respectively. There was a remarkable degree of congruence in the proportion of species that were represented in broad taxonomic groups, with prosobranch gastropods accounting for 52 to 79% of the total diversity at each locality.

By causing large reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively). Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered. Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets, I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs, and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the change in biomass and feeding position of 25cm size classes of each basslet species and calculated the growth rates of ~2cm individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2cm) fairy basslet. Predation reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were comparable to the response of these fish in populations where competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on juveniles.

Much of the past research in this area has focused on the ecological and evolutionary significance of trait plasticity by studying single predator-prey pairs and testing the performance of individuals having induced and noninduced phenotypes. This research has thus been critical in improving our understanding of the adaptive value of trait plasticity and its widespread occurrence across species and community types. More recently, researchers have expanded this foundation by examining how the complexity of organismal design and community-level properties can shape plasticity in functional traits. In addition, researchers have begun to merge evolutionary and ecological perspectives by linking trait plasticity to community dynamics, with particular attention on trait-mediated indirect interactions. Here, we review recent studies on inducible morphological plasticity in predators and their prey with an emphasis on internal and external constraints and how the nature of predator-prey interactions influences the expression of inducible phenotypes. In particular, we focus on multiple-trait plasticity, flexibility and modification of inducible plasticity, and reciprocal plasticity between predator and prey.

We studied the effects of coexistence on population densities, reproductive parameters, and survival in these two species by means of experimentation in large, predator-free outdoor enclosures. While populations of both species reached higher densities in the absence of the other, field voles appeared to suffer more from interspecific competition than sibling voles. The proportion of young individuals in the population was higher in the sibling vole than in the field vole at the end of the experiment. The presence of a coexisting species reduced the survival of field voles. Sibling voles, on the other hand, appeared to suffer more from intraspecific competition than interspecific competition. On a population level, the sibling vole seems to be a superior competitor in the absence of predators due to better survival and possibly a higher reproductive capacity. However, predation probably has a profound influence on the interspecific dynamics of these two species indicating that in natural surroundings apparent competition (i.e. competition via shared predators) is stronger than direct competition.

However, predators can alter such competitive interactions substantially. Predation can promote the coexistence of species in a situation where it would otherwise be impossible, for example if a tradeoff between the competitive abilities and predation resistance of the prey species exists. The field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis are sympatric grassland species, which compete for the same resources. At the population level sibling voles are suggested to be superior competitors to field voles, yet more vulnerable to predation. We tested the effects of predation on the two species in 0.5 ha outdoor enclosures by exposing vole populations to radio-collared freely-hunting least weasels Mustela nivalis nivalis for three weeks. Lethal and non-lethal impacts of predation limited population densities of both species during and after the experimental period, but the effect was more pronounced in sibling voles in which population densities decreased markedly during the treatment period and even after that. Field vole population densities remained stable under weasel predation, while densities increased in controls. Survival in both species was lower in treatment populations compared to controls, but the effect tended to be more pronounced in sibling voles and in females of both species. The average mass of adults in both species declined in the treatment populations. These results suggest that predation by least weasels can limit vole populations locally, even during favourable summer conditions, and have extended negative effects on the dynamics of vole populations. In addition, predation alleviated interspecific competition between the vole species and is, therefore, a potential factor enabling the coexistence of them.

We studied in experimental enclosures how closely related species, the sibling vole (Microtus levis Miller, 1908) and the field vole (Microtus agrestis (Linnaeus, 1761)), adjust their habitat use when facing either the competing species or simultaneously competition and predation risk. The species responded differently in their proportional use of two habitat types, a low cover (productive but riskier) and a high cover (safer but poorer). When alone, field voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability at low densities, but decreased its use with increasing density. Sibling voles, however, avoided the low-cover habitat in single-species populations. Under interspecific competition, the habitat-use patterns switched between species: sibling voles used the low-cover habitat according to availability, with decreasing use as densities increased. Sibling voles responded to predation risk by showing a stronger density-dependent decrease in the use of low-cover habitat. Field voles, initially using mostly high cover, did not change behaviour under risk of predation. Our results highlight the importance of considering both predation risk and interspecific competition when interpreting patterns of habitat selection among coexisting species.  2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

Summertime hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay alters field distributions, encounter rates, and predator-prey interactions between hypoxia-tolerant ctenophores, Mnemiopsis leidyi, and their less tolerant ichthy- oplankton and zooplankton prey. Omnivory and intra-guild predation (IGP) increase the complexity of food webs, thereby confounding the effects of predation versus competition on prey populations. Omnivorous ctenophores in temperate estuarine food webs can both eat and compete with fish larvae for copepod prey. We isolated the effects of predation and competition, and how low versus high DO, affect larval fish growth and survival, using a spatially explicit (three vertical layers) individual-based model of a ctenophore-fish larvae-copepod IGP food web. We simulated three alternative food web structures of how ctenophores affect fish larvae (full interactions, relaxed predation, relaxed competition) under normoxic and hypoxic DO scenarios. Results from laboratory experiments and field studies were used to configure and corroborate the model. Ctenophore predation had a bigger effect on survival of modeled fish larvae than did competition between ctenophores and fish larvae for shared zooplankton prey, but competition more strongly affected larval fish growth rates than did predation. Hypoxia versus normoxia did not alter the relative importance of ctenophore predation and competition, but low DO did decrease larval fish survival and increase larval growth rates. Model results suggest that consideration of the interaction strength in food webs and explicit treatment of spatial habitats to allow predator-prey overlap to emerge from movement will enhance our ability to predict hypoxia effects on fish.  2017.

Using two common species of Australian small mammals that have persisted in the presence of an alien predator, the European red fox Vulpes vulpes, for over a century, we hypothesised that populations of both would perform better where the activity of the predator was low than where it was high and that prey individuals would avoid signs of the predator's presence. We found no difference in prey abundance in sites with high and low fox activity, but survival of one species-the bush rat Rattus fuscipes-was almost twofold higher where fox activity was low. Juvenile, but not adult rats, avoided fox odour on traps, as did individuals of the second prey species, the brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii. Both species also showed reduced activity at foraging trays bearing fox odour in giving-up density (GUD) experiments, although GUDs and avoidance of fox odour declined over time. Young rats avoided fox odour more strongly where fox activity was high than where it was low, but neither adult R. fuscipes nor A. stuartii responded differently to different levels of fox activity. Conservation managers often attempt to eliminate alien predators or to protect predator-nave prey in protected reserves. Our results suggest that, if predator pressure can be reduced, otherwise susceptible prey may survive the initial impact of an alien predator, and experience selection to discriminate cues to its presence and avoid it over the longer term. Although predator reduction is often feasible, identifying the level of reduction that will conserve prey and allow selection for avoidance remains an important challenge.  2011 Springer-Verlag."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

In communities where experimental manipulations are often impossible (e.g., parasite communities), census data can be used to evaluate the strength or frequency of positive and negative associations among species. In ectoparasite communities, competitive associations can arise because of limited space or food, but facilitative associations can also exist if one species suppresses host immune defenses. In addition, positive associations among parasites could arise merely due to shared preferences for the same host, without any interaction going on. We used census data from 28 regional surveys of gamasid mites parasitic on small mammals throughout the Palaearctic, to assess how the abundance of individual mite species is influenced by the abundance and diversity of other mite species on the same host. After controlling for several confounding variables, the abundance of individual mite species was generally positively correlated with the combined abundances of all other mite species in the community. This trend was confirmed by meta-analysis of the results obtained for separate mite species. In contrast, there were generally no consistent relationships between the abundance of individual mite species and either the species richness or taxonomic diversity of the community in which they occur. These patterns were independent of mite feeding mode. Our results indicate either that synergistic facilitative interactions among mites increase the host's susceptibility to further attacks (e.g., via immunosuppression) and lead to different species all having increased abundance on the same host, or that certain characteristics make some host species preferred habitats for many parasite species.  2009 Springer-Verlag."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

The stem-elongation response of Chenopodium album to light competition attenuated its resistance to caterpillar herbivory in terms of herbivore mortality, but not in terms of growth of the survivors. Plant responses to herbivory did not affect subsequent responses to light competition. Thus, plants were largely able to express phenotypic plasticity (a proportional increase in the phenotype) following previous exposure to a different environmental factor. Although plants were able to express sequential plasticity, the final phenotype expressed was limited by exposure to previous environmental factors: induced resistance reduced plant height and stem elongation made plants more palatable to herbivores. Phenotypic plasticity in response to competition and herbivory may thus limit the subsequent expression of adaptive phenotypes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The variance of an effect size is typically a function of sampling error; however, it can also be influenced by study design. Here, I derive new variances and covariances for RR for several often-encountered experimental designs: when the treatment and control means are correlated; when multiple treatments have a common control; when means are based on repeated measures; and when the study has a correlated factorial design, or is multivariate.

Previous studies of multiple-stressor effects on freshwater fish suggest a prevalence of antagonistic interactions. However, taxonomy, life stage and/or environmental context likely modify the magnitude and direction of fish responses to multiple stressors. Stressor intensity, impact mechanism, exposure time and ecosystem size may further affect interaction outcomes. Large-scale studies quantifying how these variables moderate stressor interactions are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a meta-analysis of 29 factorial multiple-stressor experiments to examine the influence of seven potential moderator variables on the magnitude and direction of stressor interactions. Using weighted random-effects meta-analytic models, we demonstrate the importance of taxonomic identity and life stage for interaction outcomes. In particular, Cypriniformes showed stronger antagonisms than Salmoniformes, as did larval fish compared to juveniles. Interaction outcomes also varied among the measured fish responses with survival yielding stronger antagonisms than biomass. Increasing experimental duration and volume of the experimental units both drove interactions towards synergisms, supporting findings from previous studies that synergisms take time and space to develop. In an era when the number of stressors affecting freshwater systems is increasing rapidly, our study provides a vital step towards identifying generalities in multiple-stressor outcomes and thus improved predictions of multiple-stressor impacts. Furthermore, our meta-analysis complements studies in real streams, rivers and lakes by providing an experimentally derived context for the growing number of multiple-stressor assessments in research, management and conservation of freshwater fish.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) exhibit larger caudal regions and higher burst-swimming capabilities when coexisting with higher densities of predatory fish. It is hypothesized that a trade-off between steady (constant-speed cruising; important for acquiring resources) and unsteady (rapid bursts and turns; important for escaping predators) locomotion, combined with divergent selection on locomotor performance (favouring steady swimming in high-competition scenarios of low-predation environments, but unsteady swimming in high-predation localities) has caused such phenotypic divergence. Here, I found that morphological differences had a strong genetic basis, and low-predation fish required less hydromechanical power during steady swimming, leading to increased endurance. I further found individual-level support for cause-and-effect relationships between morphology, swimming kinematics and endurance. Results indicate that mosquitofish populations inhabiting low-predation environments have evolved increased steady-swimming abilities via stiffer bodies, larger anterior body/head regions, smaller caudal regions and greater three-dimensional streamlining.  2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We tested the direct and interactive effects of inter- and intraspecific competition, as well as of two abundant herbivore species (a generalist folivore and a specialist aphid), on the selective value of a defensive chemical compound in Brassica nigra. We found that investment in chemical defense was favored in interspecific competition but disfavored in intraspecific competition and that this pattern of selection was dependent on the presence of both herbivores, suggesting that selection will depend on the rarity or commonness of these species.

An experimental exclusion study was performed to investigate the effects of large predators on the development of hard-substrate invertebrate assemblages, whilst simultaneously quantifying changes in the abundances of meso-predators. Settlement plates were deployed subtidally and were either caged (to exclude large predators), placed in cage controls or left exposed to predation. Assemblages were collected and censused after 9, 14 and 19. weeks. The overall structure of the communities differed due to predation, and this effect was consistent through time. Encrusting bryozoans and hydroids occupied more space on exposed surfaces. Amphipod tube cover was greater in caged treatments, with the magnitude of the difference increasing through time, whilst solitary ascidian cover was greater on caged treatments in week 19 only. Meso-predators varied in their responses to large predators, with whelks more abundant in the absence of predators, whereas flatworm abundance was greater where predators were present.

Across caged and control assemblages, Shannon's diversity, Pielou's evenness, and richness of functional groups decreased with increasing latitude, but the magnitude of consumer effects on these metrics did not display consistent latitudinal gradients. Instead, latitudinal gradients in consumer effects were apparent for individual functional groups. Solitary ascidians displayed the pattern consistent with predictions of greater direct effects of predators at low than high latitude. As consumers reduced the biomass of this and other competitive dominants, groups less prone to predation (e.g., hydroids, various groups of bryozoans) were able to take advantage of freed space in the presence of consumers and show increased abundances there.This large-scale empirical study demonstrates the complexity of species interactions, and the failure of assemblage-level metrics to adequately capture consumer effects over large spatial gradients.  2017 by the Ecological Society of America"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Although several adaptive explanations have been proposed to account for age-dependent antipredator behavior, similar explanations are rarely extended to sex-specific responses. Furthermore, no attempts have been made to quantitatively estimate the direction or magnitude of these differences across studies. Here, we use meta-analysis to discover overall trends in the literature, as well as differences owing to experimental or population parameters. Across our sample of available studies (unfortunately biased toward rodents and primates), males respond more than females, and young respond more than adults. Furthermore, young of quickly maturing species display more adult-like antipredator behavior than young of slowly maturing species, suggesting that young must develop antipredator behavior at a pace consistent with the length of their ontogenetic period (a.k.a. juvenile/sub-adult period, defined as the time between birth and attainment of sexual maturity). We review previously proposed explanations for such age differences, namely, that longer ontogenetic periods may provide juveniles with time to develop behavior through learning and experience, or, maturation rates may influence age-specific selection pressures and the consequent evolution of age-specific behavioral strategies. We evaluate our results in light of these hypotheses, although our conclusions are limited by the number and taxonomic bias of available studies. We therefore suggest ways in which future studies may tease apart the relative importance of learning and experience vs. age-specific adaptive behavior, and draw attention to opportunities for research on age- and sex-specific alarm call responses.  2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Coexistence is also possible, however, when a species only has access to resources that are shared with a competitor, providing it is the superior competitor on that resource (the 'included niche'). To test predictions of these two coexistence mechanisms, we studied habitat selection of two closely related sympatric plant-specialist frogs from Madagascar (Guibemantis bicalcaratus and Guibemantis punctatus). Both species live and breed only in the water-filled leaf axils of Pandanus plants, and previous experiments with their tadpoles demonstrated asymmetric competition. In a 3-yr field study, we: (1) monitored the biotic and abiotic conditions of 348 plants; (2) surveyed these plants for frogs; (3) undertook a mark-recapture study; and (4) conducted an experiment where we manipulated the amount of detritus in plants. We identified several differences in the conditions of the habitats selected by both species (e.g., plant height, canopy cover over the plant, abundance of heterospecifics). Co-occurrence was nevertheless common, and G. punctatus persisted almost exclusively in plants it shared with G. bicalcaratus. As predicted by theory, G. punctatus was the superior competitor, at least in the tadpole stage. The inferior competitor (G. bicalcaratus) had access to exclusive resources not available to G. punctatus, by virtue of a faster developmental rate that permitted reproduction in lower quality plants. While there was some evidence of weak niche partitioning, we conclude that coexistence in these plant-specialist frogs is primarily via an included niche mechanism.

However, there is a lack of pragmatic studies linking body size and interspecific competition to patterns in ecological communities. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of body size (mass) on competitive interactions between bird pairs and to investigate the influence of food guilds. Point-counts were carried out in nine sites every month from November 2002 to November 2003 in the Cuetzalan Region, Mexico, and we used presence/absence and abundance data for the analyses. To calculate the strength of competition we used the Angle Frequency Method to extract form factors from 20 pairwise interactions. A prototype competition interaction and random pairs were also constructed. We used clustering techniques (PCA) to calculate the dissimilarity scores (distances, D) of each of the pairwise interactions to the prototype competition and random pairs and one-way ANOVA to test for differences between the means of the random and competitive pairs. The ratio in body mass (lnBM) for each of the interacting pairs was calculated, and the association between the lnBM ratio and the strength of competition (D) was tested using a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. To test for the influence of foraging guilds we used a univariate general linear model. Our results demonstrate a significant negative relationship between bird body mass ratio and competition strength - i.e. competition strength increased when the body masses of the birds became more similar. We did not find a significant influence of foraging guild on the relationship between body mass ratio and competition strength.

Certainly there have been copious, seminal works on competition in marine and freshwater ecosystems, most often on research executed at smaller ecological scales such as rocky intertidal zones, coral reefs, or littoral zones, and often involving experimental manipulation. Such studies have typically emphasized organisms with relatively high site fidelity, and all have focused primarily at the individual level. Here we springboard from those studies to explore competition among marine fishes at broader spatiotemporal scales, scales at which fish populations are distributed, scales at which their associated fisheries operate and are managed, and as observed under ambient (i.e., nonexperimental) system dynamics. Inferring that competition might be occurring among marine fishes requires four conditions: opposite population trajectories, high spatiotemporal overlap, high dietary overlap, and some indication of resource limitation. We used those criteria to examine cases of species pairings from the Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem to ascertain if there are broadly applicable rules of thumb to determine when competition might be a significant consideration. We assert that such rules exist, and where competition is strongly suspected, we provide an empirically based method of calculating first-order, model-free interaction terms that can scope the potential magnitude of competitive effects. We do so very much cognizant of several caveats and theoretical considerations; but our main premise is that estimating and evaluating competition for marine fishes from extant, commonly available data is feasible, is highly germane, and has many valuable applications for multispecies and ecosystem models as we move toward ecosystem-based fisheries management.  2013 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

A brief review of this debate reveals an issue with deep philosophical roots that is unlikely to be resolved by a better understanding of generalizations in ecology. We therefore propose a strategy for transforming the conceptual question about the nature of ecological laws into a set of empirically tractable hypotheses about the relative resilience of ecological generalizations across three dimensions: taxonomy, habitat type, and scale. These hypotheses are tested using a survey of 240 meta-analyses in ecology. Our central finding is that generalizations in community ecology are just as prevalent and as resilient as those in population or ecosystem ecology. These findings should help to establish community ecology as a generality-seeking science as opposed to a science of case studies. It also supports the capacity for ecologists, working at any of the three levels, to inform matters of public policy.  2016 by The University of Chicago Press.

While this model has largely been applied to competing species, it may also apply to predator-prey systems if predators influence intraspecific aggregation in their prey. Predators may influence intraspecific aggregation in prey communities by affecting prey immigration, emigration, and survival (both directly through predation and indirectly by modifying prey interactions and behavior). We performed a field experiment to determine whether predators influence the composition and aggregation of their macroinvertebrate prey in a marine subtidal food web. We quantified prey colonization of eight treatments that differed in the composition and richness of predators. We found between 50% and 70% of species exhibited positive intraspecific aggregation. We then asked whether the observed patterns in intraspecific aggregation among prey influenced local (alpha) diversity and turnover between local patches (beta diversity). Intraspecific aggregation was positively correlated with both alpha and beta diversity. The positive relationship between intraspecific aggregation and beta diversity was expected, however, the positive relationship between intraspecific aggregation and alpha diversity was not and runs counter to the negative relationship found in competitive communities. We suggest that the positive relationship we observed could occur because aggregation can increase prey survival and can generate a type III functional response.  2012 Elsevier B.V."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We assessed patterns of co-occurrence at four scales, in two types of tropical cloud forests in Hainan Island, China (tropical montane evergreen forests, TMEF and tropical dwarf forests, TDF) that varied significantly in soil nutrients and temperature. We tested if the patterns of co-occurrence changed when we sorted species into classes by abundance and diameter at breast height (dbh). Co-occurrence differed by forest type and with plot size, with significant species aggregation observed across larger plots in TDF and patterns of species segregation observed in smaller plots in TMEF. Analyses of differential abundance and dbh classes also showed that smaller plots in TMEF tend to have negative co-occurrence patterns, but larger plots in TDF tend to show patterns of aggregation, suggesting competitive and facilitative interactions. This underscores the scale-dependence of the processes contributing to community assembly. Furthermore, it is consistent with predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis that facilitation will be most important in biological systems subject to abiotic stress, while competition will be more important in less abiotically stressful habitats.

(2005, Journal of Ecology, 93, 748-757) recently rejected the predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis for arid and semi-arid environments in entirety. It was concluded that neither positive nor negative effects of neighbours increased with abiotic stress and that different theoretical models are now needed. 2 In light of this sweeping conclusion, we re-examined the analytical approach and explored the general synthetic power of meta-analysis. 3 Detailed statistical re-analyses demonstrated that some of the meta-analyses of Maestre et al. were robust. However, more rigorous data selection criteria, changing gradient lengths between studies and covariance in response effects did not support their original conclusions. Additionally, application of more rigorous data selection criteria did allow us to detect a significant and consistent positive effect of neighbours, which suggests that facilitation is important at many points along stress gradients. 4 Careful evaluation of the studies used by Maestre et al. also revealed serious limitations. Many studies included in the meta-analyses were not conducted along stress gradients, did not identify a stress gradient within the study, focused on invasive species or were not peer reviewed. Most importantly, however, gradient lengths were not quantified and appeared to differ dramatically among studies. This crucial source of variation was not accounted for statistically nor in the interpretations. 5 Meta-analyses are useful tools for synthesis and description but are inherently limited by the appropriateness of the data selected. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, the data available to and selected by Maestre et al. did not adequately test the stress-gradient hypothesis and cannot thus reject its value for understanding the organization of plant communities in arid systems. 6 The ecological implication of our synthesis is that meta-analytical summary statistics may not always tell the whole story. Alternative interpretations of differences in effect sizes (or lack thereof) are possible because studies will vary in their ability to test specific predictions of a hypothesis, and furthermore, a certain level of judgement is required to infer the relative importance of certain ideas to synthetic progress within a discipline.  2005 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

The environmental conditions determine which phenotypes are being produced and one of the most dangerous situations for the algae is when the organisms are confronted with strong grazing pressure from numerous zooplankton organisms. An overview is given of several aspect of an induced defense in many non-spiny Scenedesmus and some spiny Desmodesmus that may form typical protective eight-celled colonies to avoid mortality from numerous grazers. The morphological response does seem to be linked with a herbivorous zooplankton chemical cue, rather than to a more general animal excretory product. The grazing activity of small sized grazers is reduced, but not of large Daphnia. However, arguments are given why grazing protection of colonial Scenedesmus is probably more efficient under natural than under carbon/light limited laboratory conditions.

A critical reappraisal of current theoretical models is needed because experimental studies both support and refute their predictions. 2 A quantitative meta-analysis of field and common garden studies evaluating the effect of abiotic stress (low vs. high) on the net outcome of plant-plant interactions in arid and semi-arid environments was performed to evaluate the degree of empirical support for these models. We created four separate data sets corresponding to the categories of response variables commonly used to measure plant performance (survival, density, growth and fecundity). 3 The analyses showed that both the selection of the estimator of plant performance and the experimental approach followed have a strong influence on both the net outcome of plant-plant interactions and the effect of abiotic stress on such outcome. The effect of neighbours on the survival and growth of target plants was not significant at either stress level, but that on the density and fecundity of target plants was positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) at the low and high abiotic stress level, respectively. Density data showed that the net effect of neighbours was positive and negative at low and high abiotic stress levels, respectively, whereas other estimators suggested that the net effect of neighbours did not differ with stress level. None of our meta-analyses indicated that the magnitude of the net effect provided by neighbours, whether positive or negative, was higher under high abiotic stress conditions, and facilitation does not therefore appear to increase in importance with abiotic stress. 4 As the predictions of current theoretical models regarding the relationship between the net outcome of a plant-plant interaction and abiotic stress do not hold in arid and semi-arid environments, different models are needed. These should consider different sources of abiotic stress separately, and should be valid for performance measurements, such as survival, that integrate plant responses over time. The incorporation of these features into theoretical models will undoubtedly improve their predictive capabilities.  2005 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Experimental evidence of top-down predatory effects in leaf packs comes from studies assessing how large predators affect shredders and therefore the litter decomposition rate. In this study, we investigated the effects of smaller invertebrate predators on micro- and meiobenthic communities. In outdoor, flow-through stream channels, we created a gradient in the density of predacious Chloroperlidae stonefly larvae in enclosures containing alder leaf litter and exposed to natural colonisation by invertebrates and decomposers. We expected that: (i) predators would reduce the biomass and density of invertebrate colonisers, (ii) the strength of predator effects on invertebrates would vary with prey body size; and (iii) increasing predator numbers in enclosures would diminish the per capita strength of predator-prey interactions due to intraguild interference. We also anticipated that litter decomposition would be slower in the presence of predators providing that microbial decomposers did not compensate for the reduction in shredders by an increase in their biomass. Chloroperlidae had negative effects on the biomass of most major invertebrate taxa, including rotifers, nematodes and larvae of the Chironomidae Corynoneura and Brillia (the dominant shredder in leaf packs). The predatory effect on nematode biomass was strongest for dominant small-bodied species. Fungal biomass in leaf litter was reduced in the presence of predators, whereas bacterial biomass was not affected. In addition to feasible direct predation on Chironomidae, Chloroperlidae apparently inhibited meiofauna colonisation of leaf litter, probably through the bioturbation of fine sediment trapped on leaf surfaces. At the end of the experiment, the mortality of Chloroperlidae in enclosures was considerable at the highest predator density treatment. This observation, along with evidence of the reduced per capita strength of predator-prey interactions with increasing predator density, suggested that intraguild interference moderates the effect of predators in leaf packs. Our findings are consistent with a key role of small predators in determining the abundance of invertebrates and microbial decomposers in leaf packs.

These experiments have inspired a body of theoretical work to explain the variation in the effect of warming on top-down control. However, there has been no quantitative attempt to reconcile theory with outcomes from empirical studies. To address the gap between theory and experiment, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the combined effect of experimental warming and top-down control on resource biomass and determined potential sources of variation across experiments. We show that differences in experimental outcomes are related to systematic variation in the geographical distribution of studies. Specifically, warming strengthened top-down control when experiments were conducted in colder regions, but had the opposite effect in warmer regions. Furthermore, we found that differences in the thermoregulation strategy of the consumer and openness of experimental arenas to dispersal can contribute to some deviation from the overall geographical pattern. These results reconcile empirical findings and support the expectation of geographical variation in the response of consumerresource interactions to warming.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Yet, differences between these two mechanisms may lead to different cascading impacts on lower trophic levels. Using a crab-snail-barnacle rocky intertidal food chain, we tested the effects of predation risk from crabs (top predators) on intraspecific competition among snails (intermediate consumers) and emergent indirect effects on the density of and competition among barnacles (basal resources). The per capita foraging and growth rates of snails declined with high conspecific density. Predation risk from crabs, which caused even larger reductions in snail foraging and growth, weakened competition among snails, whereas a 45% increase in barnacle density had no detectable effect on snail competition. Intraspecific competition between barnacles, however, depended on the interactive effects of barnacle density, snail density, and crab predation risk. Barnacles developed hummocking morphologies as they grew and competed for space. Hummock formation (a proxy for competition) increased as a result of either greater initial barnacle density or reduced snail foraging pressure, but these effects depended on predation risk. The effects of crab predation risk on snail foraging behavior weakened an otherwise strong relationship between barnacle density and hummock development: hummocking increased with barnacle density in the absence of crabs but remained relatively high when crabs were present. In communities with similar final barnacle densities, hummocking was more common in those with crabs than those without crabs. The extent to which predators can drive trophic cascades by suppressing the foraging rates of their prey is highly context-dependent: the positive trait-mediated indirect effect of predators on basal resource abundance is stronger when many prey respond simultaneously to the threat of predation. However, our results demonstrate that top predators can also enhance competition among basal resources even when their indirect effect on resource abundance is relatively weak. Hence, the cascading effects of predators on competition within lower trophic levels may play an important but under-appreciated role in the dynamics of basal resource populations and the communities they support.

As ecosystems are simultaneously exposed to other anthropogenic influences, it is important to address the effects of climate change in the context of many stressors. Nutrient enrichment might offset some of the energy demands that warming can exert on organisms by stimulating growth at the base of the food web. It is important to know whether indirect effects of warming will be as ecologically significant as direct physiological effects. Declining body size is increasingly viewed as a universal response to warming, with the potential to alter trophic interactions. To address these issues, we used an outdoor array of marine mesocosms to examine the impacts of warming, nutrient enrichment and altered top-predator body size on a community comprised of the predator (shore crab Carcinus maenas), various grazing detritivores (amphipods) and algal resources. Warming increased mortality rates of crabs, but had no effect on their moulting rates. Nutrient enrichment and warming had near diametrically opposed effects on the assemblage, confirming that the ecological effects of these two stressors can cancel each other out. This suggests that nutrient-enriched systems might act as an energy refuge to populations of species under metabolic constraints due to warming. While there was a strong difference in assemblages between mesocosms containing crabs compared to mesocosms without crabs, decreasing crab size had no detectable effect on the amphipod or algal assemblages. This suggests that in allometrically balanced communities, the expected long-term effect of warming (declining body size) is not of similar ecological consequence to the direct physiological effects of warming, at least not over the six week duration of the experiment described here. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of declining body size on the bioenergetic balance of natural communities.  2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The different genetic lines of C. sativus were altered in their phytochrome-mediated shade responses and the production of terpenoid defence compounds. 3. Cucumber plants constitutively expressing the shade-avoidance response had 93% more herbivory by specialist beetles compared with wild types.

We then manipulated the plant phenotype by artificially imposing neighbours' shade on plants with and without cucurbitacins. As expected, plants responded to shade by growing longer hypocotyls and first internodes, but few trade-offs were found between plant line and shade treatment and, although herbivory levels were very low, there was a trend towards reduced damage on shaded plants. 5.

Multiple simultaneous interactions may constrain the ability of native species to trade fitness components (i.e., reduced growth for reduced risk of predation) causing a spiral to extinction. We found evidence for five types of interactions between the adults and juveniles of introduced western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and the juveniles of native least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis). We added ten large (23-28 mm) and seven small (9-13 mm) young-of-the-year (YOY) least chub to replicate enclosures with zero, low, and high densities of mosquitofish in a desert spring ecosystem. Treatments with mosquitofish reduced the average survival of least chub by one-third. No small YOY least chub survived in enclosures with high mosquitofish densities. We also performed two laboratory experiments to determine mortality to predation, aggressiveness, and habitat selection of least chub in the presence of mosquitofish. Mean mortality of least chub due to predation by large mosquitofish was 69.7% over a 3-h trial. Least chub were less aggressive, selected protected habitats (Potamogeton spp.), and were more stationary in the presence of mosquitofish where the dominance hierarchy was large mosquitofishlarge least chubsmall mosquitofishsmall least chub.

Including these results in assessments for the individual stocks would result in double use of the data if the assessments include the input data used in the meta-analyses, which they typically would. To solve this problem, we recommend that an additional form of results should be reported in meta-analyses: Type C, the results for a new stock obtained by sequentially excluding each stock's data set and repeating the meta-analysis.

Across the experimental mortality gradient, consumer biomass decreased and resource abundance increased with an increase in mortality. Thus, the treatments resulted in an increase in resource availability per consumer (one measure of reduced competitive intensity). There was no significant effect of mortality treatment on species relative abundances or species evenness, and the zooplankter Diaphanosoma dominated community biomass at all mortality levels.

Biotic interactions are acknowledged to be important at local scales, although their signal is assumed to weaken over longer distances. We examine the relationship between positive, neutral and negative pairwise bird abundance distributions and the phylogenetic and functional distance between these pairs after first controlling for habitat associations. Location: France and Finland. Time period: 1984 to 2011 (Finland), 2001 to 2012 (France). Major Taxa studied: Birds. Methods: We used results from French and Finnish land bird monitoring programmes, from which we created three independent datasets (French forests, French farmlands and Finnish forests). Separately for the three datasets, we fitted linear mixed-effects models for pairwise abundance values across years per point count station to infer the association between all common species pairs, while controlling for geographical distribution and habitat associations, and saved pairwise regression coefficients for further analyses. We used a null model approach to infer whether the observed associations (effect sizes) differ from random. Finally, using quantile regression, we analysed the relationships between functional dissimilarity/phylogenetic distance and effect sizes. Results: Our results show both negative and positive species interactions, although negative interactions were twice as common as positive interactions. Closely related species were more likely to show strong associations, both negative and positive, than more distant species across broad spatial scales. For functional dissimilarity, the results varied across datasets. Main conclusions: Our results emphasize the potential of functional and phylogenetic proximity in generating both negative and positive species associations, which can produce pervasive patterns from local to geographical scales. Future assembly studies should refrain from strict dichotomies, such as compensatory dynamics versus environmental forcing, and instead consider the possibility of positive interactions.  2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

A significant reduction was observed in the level of leaf damage and plant mortality. The presence of birds also positively affected the amount of plant biomass, whereas effects on plant growth were negligible. There were no differences in the effects between agricultural and natural environments. Similarly, plants performed better in all climatic areas (tropical, temperate and boreal) when birds were present.

Three of the plant species, Borrichia frutescens, Coccoloba uvifera, and Baccharis halimifolia, grew close to the shore, while the two remaining species, Myrica cerifera and Persea borbonia, grew in upland areas with lower salinity and no tidal input. For each species, we added nitrogen fertilizer and reduced parasitism with sticky traps in a fully factorial design, and assessed the relative impacts of these bottom-up and top-down manipulations on the most common herbivores of each plant. We then used a within-study meta-analysis to integrate the results and quantitatively compare the strengths of top-down and bottom-up effects on the herbivores of these coastal and upland plants. Both fertilization and reduction of parasitism resulted in significant increases in herbivore densities, and the effects of these treatments were only slightly more pronounced for herbivores of the upland plant species than the coastal plant species. The greatest difference, however, between coastal and upland systems was in the strength of the interaction between nutrients and parasitism. Fertilization strongly increased the effects of parasitism for herbivores of upland plants, but not coastal plants. Correlations between effect sizes and ambient salinity and foliar nitrogen levels showed that environmental stress levels may be principally responsible for the strength of interaction between bottom-up and top-down forces, but nutrient levels likely play a lesser role."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

I documented the individual and combined effects of birds (chickadees, nuthatches, warblers) and ants (Formica podzolica) on arthropods residing in pine (Pinus ponderosa) canopies in a factorial field experiment. Birds and ants removed herbivores but simultaneously benefited them by removing predatory arthropods. Birds and ants had net negative and positive effects, respectively, on the abundance of herbivore prey, supporting the notion that vertebrate predators have stronger negative effects on herbivores than do arthropod predators. Aphids (ant-tended and untended species) constituted three-quarters of herbivore biomass. The effect of birds on ant-tended aphids was twice that on untended aphid species or tended aphid species without ants. This was not due to there being more ant-tended aphids for birds to prey on; tended and untended aphid species were in similar abundances in the absence of birds. Instead, the effects of birds were strengthened by attributes of the mutualism that rendered tended aphids susceptible to predation. These dynamics led to nonadditive effects of birds and ants: birds only reduced tended aphid species and total herbivore abundances on trees with ants, while ants only increased tended aphid species and total herbivore abundances in the absence of birds. Consequently, top predators in this system only influenced total herbivore abundance when they disrupted an ant-aphid mutualism.  2006 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Studying these interactions under fluctuating food availability, while taking habitat characteristics into account, offers a quasi-experimental setup to determine the relative impact of con-and heterospecifics on reproductive success of predators. We analyzed the settlement decisions and reproductive success of Eurasian Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in the presence of both breeding conspecifics and their competitor and intraguild predator, Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus), under fluctuating abundance of their primary prey (voles). We used detailed data, collected across 11 years in a large study area (1300 km), on the spatial and temporal variation of habitat characteristics in all available nesting sites, local densities of both species, and vole abundance. We found that Pygmy Owls strongly avoided breeding close to conspecifics but did not avoid Tengmalm's Owl nests. Nest box occupation of Pygmy Owls was positively correlated to the proportion of old spruce, mature and old pine forests, and farmlands, and occupation probability was higher at high vole abundance and in areas occupied in previous years. Pygmy Owl avoidance of conspecifics decreased when voles were abundant. At high conspecific density, Pygmy Owls showed lower hatching success and delayed hatching date, in agreement with the observed spatial avoidance. Finally, even though breeding Pygmy Owls did not spatially avoid Tengmalm's Owls, the density of heterospecifics correlated with low hatching and fledging success in Pygmy Owls. This suggests short term fitness costs when living close to competitors, even when lethal effects of intraguild interactions are subtle. Our results suggest that joint costs of exploitative and interference competition by Tengmalm's Owls, as well as intraguild predation, were lower than those induced by intraspecific competition only. This result might be due to the similar body size between the species considered, Tengmalm's Owls being only twice as large as Pygmy Owls. Interactions among con-and heterospecifics can therefore modify the spatial settlement and reproductive success of individuals on a landscape scale, also within the predator guild.  2016 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Moreover, effects of different species may not be independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant-enemy and plant-mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the magnitude of (negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground mutualists (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the greenhouse (but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to non-crop plants (suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among studies.  2007 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Each species exhibited a unique suite of behavioral responses associated with species and competitor size. Ambystoma opacum displayed high levels of aggression, most often towards conspecifics, but these behaviors rarely resulted in predation. Conversely, A. jeffersonianum displayed aggression frequently and often consumed both con- and heterospecific larvae. Furthermore, this species did not reduce aggression even in the presence of larger larvae. Ambystoma maculatum displayed relatively low levels of aggression under most circumstances. We conclude that these characteristic responses are associated with species-specific morphological and developmental features and the temporally staggered pattern in which these species appear in ponds.

In a laboratory experiment, we evaluated the relative importance of competition and predation from juvenile and adult brown trout, respectively, on foraging performance of groups of three stone loaches. We observed loach consumption rate, time spent inactive, and aggressive interactions between juvenile trout and loach in artificial stream sections. The controlled experiments were complemented by examining stone loach population densities in natural systems as functions of juvenile and adult trout. In the laboratory experiments, increasing numbers of competitors decreased prey availability, which ultimately led to lower consumption rates for loach. Loach responded to predation risk by increasing time being inactive, thereby decreasing consumption rates. However, there were no effects of juvenile trout competitors on loach consumption rates in treatments with adult trout presence, suggesting no additive effect of predation and competition on loach foraging success. Partial regressions of loach and trout densities in natural streams revealed a positive relationship between juvenile trout and loach, and a negative relationship between adult trout and loach. Our laboratory and field data thus suggest that predation is a limiting factor for loach success, and predator presence could mediate species coexistence at high interspecific densities.

In the snowbed, the exclusion of herbivorous mammals resulted in a significant increase in the biomasses of vascular plants and cryptogams, whereas no corresponding response was observed on the tall herb meadow. The intensity of competition, measured with a neighbour removal experiment, did not differ significantly between three of the four habitat X treatment combinations - snowbed exclosures, meadow exclosures and open meadow plots - but was significantly lower on open snowbed plots. Our results thus suggest that the low competition intensity in the unproductive snowbed is caused by herbivorous mammals, which tend to depress plant biomass in relatively unproductive habitats. When herbivorous mammals have been excluded for a sufficiently long time to allow the build-up of plant biomass even in unproductive habitats, between-habitat differences in competition intensity disappear."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Although the evidence of greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus, tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall, phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients, light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile task because different traits favor invasiveness in different environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global macro-analyses.  2011 The Authors.

The ecological effects of predator removal have been investigated widely; however, predator removal can also change natural selection acting on prey, resulting in contemporary evolution. Here we tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary evolution of trophic traits in prey. We utilized a historical introduction experiment where Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were relocated from a site with predatory fishes to a site lacking predators. To assess the trophic consequences of predator release, we linked individual morphology (cranial, jaw, and body) to foraging performance. Our results show that predator release caused an increase in guppy density and a ""sharpening"" of guppy trophic traits, which enhanced food consumption rates. Predator release appears to have shifted natural selection away from predator escape ability and towards resource acquisition ability. Related diet and mesocosm studies suggest that this shift enhances the impact of guppies on lower trophic levels in a fashion nuanced by the omnivorous feeding ecology of the species. We conclude that extirpation of top predators may commonly select for enhanced feeding performance in prey, with important cascading consequences for communities and ecosystems.  2011 Palkovacs et al."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Despite significant climate differences the browsing trends at both mines were similar. By the first harvest (2 months after establishment) there were significant reductions in shoot mass and survival for five species exposed to browsing, while plants at high density were 25% smaller than widely spaced plants. By the second harvest (10 months), this increased to 7 of the 16 species, while spacing effects diminished. We showed the effects of herbivory to be profound, while interactions at the seedling stage were minimal. Species with higher levels of protein were not favoured, while those highest in tannins, salts and sulfur were usually avoided. As with other medium-sized herbivores, plant architecture (leaf shape) was a prominent selective agent: in this case, grasses and grasslike species were most likely to be selected and adversely affected, though some dicots were readily consumed. Browsing optimization (benefiting from herbivory) was identified in three native legumes with high growth rates. In our study, herbivore choice often equated to herbivore impact; however, future planting in rehabilitated areas should allow for resilience and compensation by some species.

There is much debate concerning which ecological constraints are the most limiting factors to seedling recruitment in disturbed communities. We provide the first comparison between selective herbivory and plant competition effects among two post-mined forest ecosystems (primary succession) and one post-fire woodland ecosystem (secondary succession). Animal exclosure assessments of nine common species across eight sites were performed for comparison within three locations separated by up to 200 km. Additionally, we asked whether pre-browsed plants differed in nutrient content between or within species in the separate systems. Results. Among the nine common species, seven of these were affected by mammal herbivory while five shared a similar vulnerability to predation regardless of system. One species was limited by competition (planting density). There was a strong linear correlation between herbivore selectivity (% browsed) and impact (biomass loss) on the fertilized minesites, but not post-fire sites. Phosphorus and potassium were higher for most species in the post-mined system. Principal components analyses revealed that nutrients in shortest supply may be the most likely components of selection within each system. Among all locations, species with highest levels of phosphorus, ADF and leaf water content were often favoured, while high tannins and nitrogen content were generally selected against. Conclusion. Herbivory, rather than seedling competition, was the limiting factor for plant performance among post-fire and post-mined reclamation areas. The post-fire seedlings were smaller and more water and nutrient limited, nevertheless browsing prevalence was equivalent at all locations with nearly all seedlings predated.

Much debate has arisen over an appropriate index to evaluate herbivore and competition effects on restored communities. We assessed concurrent environmental pressures by means of repeated measurements using three common indices of plant performance (biomass, shoot extension, and survival) in conjunction with monitoring for number and timing of plants eaten. Our design incorporated 24 species, representing a range of taxonomic groups and growth forms, planted at low and high densities, inside and outside large-scale mammal exclosures. We demonstrate that biomass and height measurements are correlated (at both the individual and the combined species levels), whereas the survival index often showed independent information. Using the most conservative measure (survival), we delineate between plant deaths attributed to seasonal effects, competition (some facilitation was apparent), and herbivory (both compensation and loss of fitness were demonstrated). Plant spacing effects depended on the index (response variable) and whether we measured individual or combined species. The survival index rarely showed competition effects. Due to counter facilitation effects, competition was not demonstrated for any index at the combined species level. The comparison of the relative order and magnitude of plants being eaten against impact identified vulnerable and compensating species. Once identified, compensating species may be used sacrificially to buffer damage in new reclamation systems, whereas deterrents may be used around known vulnerable species.  2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Meeting this challenge is increasingly imperative in the Anthropocene where climate change and exotic species introductions alter abiotic context and biotic composition to reshuffle natural systems. We created plant assemblages consisting of monocultures or equal abundance of the native community dominant bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and the exotic spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), a co-occurring invasive forb that has overtaken grasslands across the western United States. We subjected these composition treatments to drought (20% of average precipitation vs. average) and herbivory on C.stoebe by its biocontrol agent Cyphocleonus achates to explore how reduced precipitation might influence the effects of competition and biocontrol herbivory on C.stoebe's abundance. At the end of 7years, C.stoebe dominated mixed-species plots under normal precipitation conditions, with biomass 50% greater than that of the native P.spicata. However, under drought stress, P.spicata's biomass was >200% greater than C.stoebe's. Interestingly, both species were impervious to drought in monoculture, indicating the importance of the drought by competition interaction. The biocontrol herbivore reduced C.stoebe abundance and indirectly increased P.spicata biomass in mixed-species drought plots, but these effects were only marginally significant and relatively weak. Overall, C.stoebe abundance was primarily driven by the drought by competition interaction, with negatively additive but weak effects of the drought by herbivory interaction. The response of the exotic to the treatments was driven by rapid changes in population density linked to its fast life-history strategy, while the native's response was driven by changes in per capita plant biomass linked to its slower life-history strategy. Individual plant performance metrics did not predict overall population responses for the invader, indicating the importance of longer term population measures. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that reduced precipitation inputs linked to climate change can dramatically shift the balance of plant competition, even toggling the advantage from exotic to native dominance. They also illustrate the importance of biotic interactions in predicting species responses to abiotic change.  2017 The Authors.

Such coexistence can be facilitated by species at higher trophic levels through complex multi-trophic interactions, a mechanism that could be compromised by ongoing defaunation. We investigated cascading effects of defaunation on Pachymerus cardo and Speciomerus giganteus, the specialized insect seed predators of the Neotropical palm Attalea butyracea, testing the hypothesis that vertebrate frugivores and granivores facilitate their coexistence. Laboratory experiments showed that the two seed parasitoid species differed strongly in their reproductive ecology. Pachymerus produced many small eggs that it deposited exclusively on the fruit exocarp (exterior). Speciomerus produced few large eggs that it deposited exclusively on the endocarp, which is normally exposed only after a vertebrate handles the fruit. When eggs of the two species were deposited on the same fruit, Pachymerus triumphed only when it had a long head start, and the loser always succumbed to intraguild predation. We collected field data on the fates of 6569 Attalea seeds across sites in central Panama with contrasting degrees of defaunation and wide variation in the abundance of vertebrate frugivores and granivores. Speciomerus dominated where vertebrate communities were intact, whereas Pachymerus dominated in defaunated sites. Variation in the relative abundance of Speciomerus across all 84 sampling sites was strongly positively related to the proportion of seeds attacked by rodents, an indicator of local vertebrate abundance. Synthesis. We show that two species of insect seed predators relying on the same host plant species are niche differentiated in their reproductive strategies such that one species has the advantage when fruits are handled promptly by vertebrates and the other when they are not. Defaunation disrupts this mediating influence of vertebrates and strongly favours one species at the expense of the other, providing a case study of the cascading effects of defaunation and its potential to disrupt coexistence of non-target species, including the hyperdiverse phytophagous insects of tropical forests.  2016 The Authors.

The identification of synergism or antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other, the definition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic to one stressor's effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed in situations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of ""mitigating synergism"" is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset compiled by Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative). We emphasize the need for reconsideration by the ecological community of the interpretation of synergism and antagonism in situations where individual stressor effects oppose each other or where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced.

Both species' spatial occurrence tended to reflect avoidance of a larger marine predatory cottid, the Pacific staghorn sculpin Leptocottus armatus, but the predator overlapped more with prickly sculpin Cottus asper than with coastrange sculpin C. aleuticus. Survival of coastrange sculpin was reduced more than threefold in experimental assays that exposed juveniles to predation risk, which was statistically consistent with the principle of mortality-to-growth ratio (/g) minimization. A subsequent experiment measured foraging on depletable food patches during exposure to the threat of predation risk (from an enclosed predator that was prevented from causing lethal effects); juvenile and adult coastrange sculpin reduced their foraging effort 20-30% relative to a predator-free situation. Examining the foraging cost of predation for both coastrange sculpin and prickly sculpin yielded ambiguous results regarding the partitioning of resources and predator avoidance. Adults of each species differed in their responses to predation risk, but the juvenile comparison was complicated by variable resource densities (marine invertebrates) for each species.

Early life stages of marine organisms are potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated with global change, but identifying general patterns across studies, species and response variables is challenging. This review represents the first meta-analysis of multistressor studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to larvae), particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic stressors and early life stages are also identified. The meta-analysis yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic interactions (65% of individual tests) are more common than additive (17%) or antagonistic (17%) interactions. (2) Larvae are generally more vulnerable than embryos to thermal and pH stress. (3) Survival is more likely than sublethal responses to be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress. (4) Interaction types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and biological responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5) Ocean acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic than single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still oversimplify complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data from them must be cautiously interpreted with regard to extrapolation to field conditions. Nonetheless, our results identify taxa with early life stages that may be particularly vulnerable (e.g. molluscs, echinoderms) or robust (e.g. arthropods, cnidarians) to abiotic stress.

After one year of exposure, 16 species showed evidence of greater mortality and/or reduced shoot mass due to mammal herbivory. Two species had reduced shoot mass at high density (competition) and two had the reverse (facilitation), both annulled in the presence of herbivores due to poor growth at both densities.

Thus, it is predicted that prey will allocate limited resources either to competitive phenotypes to grow or to defensive phenotypes to defend, but not both. Evidence from plants, however, has suggested that under strong selection prey might evolve phenotypes that allow them to simultaneously compete and defend. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we investigated phenotypic investment in asymmetrically competing tadpoles of Rhacophorus schlegelii (RS) and Pelophylax nigromaculatus (PN) in the presence and absence of predatory dragonfly larvae. We predicted that, because of differences in resource acquisition abilities, tadpoles would invest in competitive and defensive phenotypes differently, depending on their relative competitive ability in the presence of predators. RS was the superior competitor and depressed the growth of PN whether predators were present or absent. As expected, the inferior competitor (PN) responded to competition by elongating its gut in predator-free environments. In contrast, the superior competitor (RS) did not respond to competition. In the presence of predators, both tadpoles invested in larger tails, a common defensive trait, while the presence of competitors did not influence tail size. When reared alone in the presence of predators, PN grew faster and tended to have a longer gut. In contrast to theoretical predictions, however, in the presence of both predators and competitors the inferior competitor (PN) still maintained the competitive (long gut) and defensive (large tail) phenotypes despite being depressed in growth. Optimal digestion theory suggests that gut elongation should enhance assimilation efficiency and energy gain. In this view, when a competitive phenotype also serves to benefit prey in predator environments, prey may be able to both compete and defend.  2016 The Zoological Society of London"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Researchers have frequently examined the roles of competition and predation in terrestrial or semi-aquatic communities of salamanders, but have rarely examined the influence of these factors between these communities. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory behavioral experiments (1) to test hypotheses, derived from by a previous laboratory study, in a semi-natural setting and (2) to formulate new hypotheses regarding novel species-pair combinations. Our mesocosm experiments did not support a previous hypothesis of predation by Desmognathus fuscus (a semi-aquatic species) on Plethodon cinereus (a terrestrial species), but did support a prediction that P. cinereus would avoid D. fuscus. We predicted that behavioral experiments between pairs of semiaquatic species would demonstrate predatory behavior by D. fuscus toward E. cirrigera and aggressive behavior by D. ochrophaeus toward Eurycea cirrigera; we did not find strong evidence for either predation or aggression. This finding was surprising given the similar activity patterns and dietary habits of these species. Although we predicted that Desmognathus might influence local distributions of heterogeneric salamanders through interspecific aggression in a manner similar to that seen within this genera, we found that both D. fuscus and D. ochrophaeus displayed much less aggression than expected. However, D. fuscus, in particular, appears to induce avoidance behavior in both P. cinereus and E. cirrigera without evidence of predation or excessive aggression, indicating that interference competition may be an important factor in structuring plethodontid communities.

Decades of empirical investigations have documented hundreds of examples of phenotypic plasticity, yet most studies have focused on the presence or absence of a single environmental factor. As a result, we know little about how organisms respond to gradients of environmental factors (i.e., threshold responses vs. continuous responses), nor do we understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental variables. I examined how larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) altered their behavior, morphology, and growth in response to combined gradients of predation and competition. Increased predation risk induced lower activity, deeper tails, and shorter bodies, which collectively caused slower growth. Increased competition caused slower growth which induced higher activity, shallower tails, and longer bodies. For both environmental gradients, the responses were frequently continuous rather than threshold responses. Moreover, predation and competition had interactive effects. Responses to predators were always larger under low competition than under high competition. Responses to competition were larger under low predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in the same direction, but larger under high predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in opposite directions. The results demonstrate that responses to phenotypically plastic traits can be fine-tuned to a wide variety of environmental combinations."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Growth, mass at metamorphosis, date of metamorphosis, and survival were used as measures of response to interspecific competition. A mechanistic approach was used to collect information on the behaviour of the two species in different conditions. The competitive superiority of Pelodytes at individual level was correlated with a larger body, faster growth rate, increased per capita competitive impact on conspecifics, and greater reduction in the availability of trophic and spatial resources. In the presence of Pelodytes, Bufo showed slower growth, smaller size at metamorphosis and reduced survival. In the interspecific treatments Bufo individuals modified their behaviour by increasing activity and use of the water column while Pelodytes did not change their foraging activity or space use in the aquaria. However, the presence of Bufo resulted in a reduced larval period and smaller size at metamorphosis. We hypothesise that the presence of Bufo act as a signal of environmental degradation and shorten the larval period of Pelodytes, a typical temporal pond breeder. The smaller Bufo tadpoles are potentially stronger competitors at population level because they use relatively large amounts of energy (greater densities and higher metabolic rates). Consequently, they use larger proportions of the shared resources than their larger competitor. A possible evolutionary response for larger tadpoles is the development of interference mechanisms or ""escaping"" from ephemeral ponds where mortality by drying represent a high risk."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Body size and activity level were used as explanatory covariables to determine competitive ability among species. An asymmetric and hierarchical relationship was found among the six species.

One possible consequence of these competitive interactions is an alteration of species co-occurrence patterns in the recipient community on a regional scale. In the non-invaded area, the checkerboard score (C-score) of co-occurrence indicated that the community was structured, whereas the standardized C-score in the invaded area indicated that the community did not differ significantly from having a random structure.

Most research in this area is focused on large-bodied predators, despite the high extinction risk of small-bodied freshwater fish that often act as apex consumers. Consequently, it remains unknown if intermittent streams are affected by the consequences of top-predators' extirpations. The aim of our research was to determine how this global problem affects intermittent streams and, in particular, if the loss of a small-bodied top predator (1) leads to a 'mesopredator release ', affects primary consumers and changes whole community structures, and (2) triggers a cascade effect modifying the ecosystem function. To address these questions, we studied the topdown effects of a small endangered fish species, Barbus meridionalis (the Mediterranean barbel), conducting an enclosure/exclosure mesocosm experiment in an intermittent stream where B. meridionalis became locally extinct following a wildfire.We found that top predator absence led to 'mesopredator release' , and also to 'prey release' despite intraguild predation, which contrasts with traditional food web theory. In addition, B. meridionalis extirpation changed whole macroinvertebrate community composition and increased total macroinvertebrate density. Regarding ecosystem function, periphyton primary production decreased in apex consumer absence. In this study, the apex consumer was functionally irreplaceable; its local extinction led to the loss of an important functional role that resulted in major changes to the ecosystem's structure and function. This study evidences that intermittent streams can be affected by the consequences of apex consumers' extinctions, and that the loss of small-bodied top predators can lead to large ecosystem changes. We recommend the reintroduction of small-bodied apex consumers to systems where they have been extirpated, to restore ecosystem structure and function.  2015 Rodrguez-Lozano et al."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Most predators are cannibalistic, and as a consequence, even systems with only one predator and one prey include two prey types: conspecifics and heterospecifics. The effects of the complex direct and indirect interactions that emerge in such cannibalistic systems are still poorly understood. This study examined how the indirect interaction between conspecific and heterospecific prey affects cannibalism and predation rates and how the direct interactions between both species indirectly alter the effect of the cannibalistic predator. I tested for these effects using larvae of the stream salamanders Eurycea cirrigera (prey) and Pseudotriton ruber (cannibalistic predator) by manipulating the relative densities of the conspecific and heterospecific prey in the presence and absence of the predator in experimental streams. The rates of cannibalism and heterospecific prdation were proportional to the respective densities and negatively correlated, indicating a positive indirect interaction between conspecific and heterospecific prey, similar to ""apparent mutualism."" Direct interactions between prey species did not alter the effect of the predator. Although both types of prey showed a similar 30% reduction in night activity and switch in microhabitat use in response to the presence of the predator, cannibalism rates were three times higher than heterospecific predation rates irrespective of the relative densities of the two types of prey. Cumulative predation risks differed even more due to the 48% lower growth rate of conspecific prey. Detailed laboratory experiments suggest that the 3:1 difference in cannibalism and prdation rate was due to the higher efficiency of heterospecific prey in escaping immediate attacks. However, no difference was observed when the predator was a closely related salamander species, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, indicating that this difference is species specific. This demonstrates that cannibalism can result in the coupling of predator and prey mortality rates that strongly determines the dynamics of predator-prey systems.  2008 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We conducted a pond experiment to explore the contribution of both competition and predation to character divergence in threespine stickleback species. We estimated the strength of divergent selection on a morphologically intermediate target population between competition treatments under two alternate predation treatments. Divergent selection on the target population tended to be stronger in the predator-addition treatment than in the predator-reduction treatment, a difference that approached significance (P = 0.09). This trend occurred even though competition was strongest in the predator-reduction treatment. Overall, the strength of divergent selection was best predicted by stickleback mortality (P = 0.025) being strongest where mortality was highest. These results indicate that predation and other agents of mortality can enhance the rate of change in competition per unit of phenotypic divergence and, thereby, divergent selection, even as they lower the overall strength of competition. In this way, predation and other agents of mortality may facilitate, rather than hinder, character displacement."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive night-time warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming, results from the meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2-9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3-6.0C significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20% (with a 95% confidence interval of 18-22%), net N mineralization rates by 46% (with a 95% confidence interval of 30-64%), and plant productivity by 19% (with a 95% confidence interval of 15-23%). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture, site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we should be cautious in ""scaling up"" responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level. Overall, ecosystem-warming experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Our results showed that predator origin (native versus alien) had a highly significant effect on prey responses, with alien predators having an impact double that of native predators. Also the interaction between location (mainland versus island) and predator origin was significant, revealing the strongest effects with alien predators in mainland areas. Although both these results were mainly influenced by the huge impact of alien predators on the Australian mainland compared with their impact elsewhere, the results demonstrate that introduced predators can impose more intense suppression on remnant populations of native species and hold them further from their predator-free densities than do native predators preying upon coexisting prey.  2007 The Royal Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

To assess predator impacts, we performed a worldwide meta-analysis of field experiments in which the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators were manipulated and the responses of their terrestrial vertebrate prey were measured. Our results show that predation indeed limits prey populations, as prey densities change substantially after predator manipulations. The main determinant of the result of an experiment was the efficiency of predator manipulation. Positive impacts of predator manipulation appeared to increase with duration of the experiment for non-cyclic prey, while the opposite was true for cyclic prey. In addition, predator manipulation showed a large positive impact on cyclic prey at low prey densities, but had no obvious impact at peak prey densities. As prey population densities generally respond predictably to predator manipulations, we suggest that control of introduced vertebrate predators can be used to effectively conserve and manage native wildlife. However, care should be taken when controlling native predators, especially apex species, owing to their importance as strong interactors and the biodiversity value of their habitats. We discuss gaps in our knowledge of predator-prey relationships and methodological issues related to manipulation experiments. An important guideline for future studies is that adequate monitoring of predator numbers before and during the experiment is the only way to ensure that observed responses in prey populations are actually caused by changes in predation impacts.  2010 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

In many systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering with the natural behavior of the animals. Consequently, these studies can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and exploitation on the forager's feeding rate, namely, it usually decreases in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a simple experimental and statistical procedure that facilitates the separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation. This procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is based on multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation can be neglected at the beginning of the foraging experiment because, initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey capture rates. Using both the results of an individual-based simulation and a field experiment dataset of gerbils foraging for seeds in an artificial food patch located in the field, we demonstrate that our procedure can successfully detect and separate the effect of interference from the combined overall effect of competition (i.e., interference plus exploitation).  2008 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Escape from enemies during the process of introduction has long been hypothesized to drive the increased performance of invasive species. However, recent studies and quantitative syntheses find that invaders often receive similar, or even more, damage from enemies than do native species. Therefore, invasives may be those more tolerant to enemy damage, or those able to maintain competitive ability in light of enemy damage. Here, we investigate whether tolerance and competitive ability could contribute to invasive plant success. We determined whether invasive plants were more competitive than native or noninvasive exotic species in both the presence and absence of simulated herbivory. We found competition and herbivory additively reduced individual performance, and affected the performance of native, invasive, and noninvasive exotic species to the same degree. However, invasives exerted stronger competitive effects on an abundant native species (Elymus canadensis) in both the presence and absence of herbivory. Therefore, while invasive species responded similarly to competition and simulated herbivory, their competitive effects on natives may contribute to their success in their introduced range.  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

However, little is known of the effects that invasive species have on individual species and specific mechanisms by which species displacement occurs. The expansion of western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis beyond its native range has commonly been thought to cause shifts in species assemblages throughout the United States. Although plains topminnow Fundulus sciadicus populations have declined as the range of western mosquitofish in Nebraska has expanded, long-term co-existence of mosquitofish with the closely related northern plains killifish Fundulus kansae has been observed within the same systems. To investigate the potential mechanisms by which differential displacement of the native topminnow species may have occurred, biotic interactions and spatial distribution of both conspecific and heterospecific groups of plains topminnow, plains killifish, and western mosquitofish were quantified in microcosms for three life stages (larval, juvenile, and adult). Interactions between adult western mosquitofish and the native species were complex and dependent upon life stage, but collectively suggested that populations of both plains topminnow and plains killifish are vulnerable to mosquitofish establishment. Detrimental effects towards fundulid species were primarily mediated through predation of larvae and aggressive interactions directed towards juvenile life stages which caused significant mortality. In addition, simultaneous alterations of behavior, as quantified by activity patterns and microhabitat use, were apparent in both native species in response to western mosquitofish presence. Because similar impacts of western mosquitofish were observed for plains killifish and plains topminnow, the persistence of plains killifish in areas occupied by western mosquitofish may be linked to species attributes not assessed in the current analysis. Subtle differences in microhabitat selection between the topminnow species and adult western mosquitofish could potentially explain observed differential displacement in the environment. These results have augmented our understanding of the impacts that western mosquitofish has on the at-risk plains topminnow, and have further elucidated the potential mechanisms for impact via competitive interactions.  2015 The Author(s)."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Results: A clear influence of grazing exclusion on soil properties and plant community composition and structure was found but no influence on species diversity. However, only three soil parameters (organic matter, K, and Mg, with higher values in the ungrazed community) were related to the differences in floristic composition. Species responses to the soil gradient from ungrazed to grazed areas were also related to their particular life-history traits. No trend in the dispersal-mode replacement was found.

To these ends we reviewed a set of 227 comparisons from 52 studies designed to quantify the effect of density on the growth performance of larval anurans. We predicted that both design and outcome would be related to experimental venue (laboratory, mesocosm, and field). We found that, in contrast to our predictions, laboratory experiments did not include more factors or yield more precise estimates of responses compared with mesocosm and field manipulations. In partial support of our prediction, we found that laboratory experiments did utilize somewhat larger numbers of replicates and included more levels per factor compared to the alternative venues. In addition we found that, as predicted, raising tadpoles at higher densities of conspecifics, or in the presence of heterospecifics tended to decrease growth. This effect, consistent with competition, was strongly dependent on experimental venue. In particular, we found that interspecific effects were much stronger in mesocosm versus field manipulations. This result is particularly relevant because conceptions of amphibian assemblages have included interspecific competition as integral to natural patterns of amphibian distribution. We conclude that hypothesized trade-offs among experimental venues have not acted in a particularly strong way in shaping the design of tadpole density manipulations. However, venue may mediate strong effects on the outcome of such experiments. Quantification of such methodology based biases will help ecologists more effectively match the goals of their experiments with decisions regarding venue."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

We investigated the role of several factors in promoting coexistence among the aphids Aphis nerii, Aphis asclepiadis, and Myzocallis asdepiadis that all specialize on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). Competitive exclusion is thought to occur when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. Consequently, we investigated whether predators, mutualists, or resource quality affected the strength of intra- vs. interspecific competition among aphids in factorial manipulations of competition with exposure to prdation, ants, and variable plant genotypes in three separate experiments. In the prdation  competition experiment, predators reduced aphid per capita growth by 66%, but the strength of intra- and interspecific competition did not depend on predators. In the ants  competition experiment, ants reduced per capita growth of A. nerii and M. asclepiadis (neither of which were mutualists with ants) by approximately one-half. In so doing, ants ameliorated the negative effects of these competitors on ant-tended A. asclepiadis by two-thirds, representing a novel benefit of ant-aphid mutualism. Nevertheless, ants alone did not explain the persistence of competitively inferior A. asclepiadis as, even in the presence of ants, interspecific competition remained stronger than intraspecific competition. In the plant genotype  competition experiment, both A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis were competitively inferior to A. nerii, with the strength of interspecific competition exceeding that of intraspecific competition by 83% and 23%, respectively. Yet these effects differed among milkweed genotypes, and there were one or more plant genotypes for each aphid species where coexistence was predicted. A synthesis of our results shows that predators play little or no role in preferentially suppressing competitively dominant A. nerii. Nonetheless, A. asclepiadis benefits from ants, and A. asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis may escape competitive exclusion by A. nerii on select milkweed genotypes. Taken as a whole, the coexistence of three host-specific aphid species sharing the same resource was promoted by the dual action of ants as antagonists and mutualists and by genetic diversity in the plant population itself.  2008 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

In the absence of clear quantitative guidelines linking the change in habitat to fish, resource managers often use the change in habitat area as a basis for decisions. To assess the weight of scientific evidence in support of management decisions, we summarized both the observational and experimental freshwater fish-habitat literature. We then extracted data from experimental studies (where possible) for inclusion in a meta-analysis, to provide a more rigorous assessment of the published results of experimental habitat manipulations. We found relatively strong and consistent correlational evidence linking fish and physical habitat features, yet inconsistent evidence when narratively reviewing the experimental literature. On the whole, decreases in structural habitat complexity are detrimental to fish diversity and can change species composition. Increases in structural complexity showed increases, decreases, or no measurable changes in species and (or) communities. The majority of our meta-analyses resulted in supporting a direct link between habitat and fish abundance or biomass, with fish biomass responding most strongly to habitat change. Habitat alterations are most likely to affect individual species or community structure, and thus evaluating the extent of the effect on a biological basis depends on management objectives.  2007 NRC Canada."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

One unique, adaptive response to intraguild competition is arboreal caching ('hoisting') by leopards. Hoisting behaviour is thought to vary in frequency among individuals, populations, and between sexes. In our study, leopards fed primarily (85% of observed kills)onimpala (Aepycerosmelampus), which isthe most locally abundant potential prey species. Although we did not detect statistical differences in hoisting rates among individuals within each sex, our results confirmed moderate hoisting rates of 35% in an area with medium densities of lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and African wild dogs (Lycaonpictus).Sex differences in prey hoisting were related to size, and males as the larger sex, hoisted kills (47.7%, n= 44) more often than overlapping females (27%, n= 62). Female leopards hoisted 25-33% of detected kills irrespective of prey size, season, habitat type, presence of dependent cubs, or location in relation to high competitor density areas ('competitor hotspots'). Consistent with this, males hoisted kills more often where visibility and, therefore, probability ofdetection was highest.We conclude that hoisting is likely correlated with energetic costs, seasonally increased detection by competitors, and direct competitor interactions rather than the potential risk of conflicts within generalized areas of high competitor use ('hotspots')."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

However, recent work has indicated that the quality of the food may also be critically important for some marine predators. The 'junkfood hypothesis' was originally suggested as a potential explanation for a dramatic population decline of Stellers sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in the Gulf of Alaska. According to the hypothesis, a dietary switch to prey of low energy content led to detrimental effects on the population of sea lions. A number of observations indicate that the hypothesis is relevant for several population parameters. Recent work on piscivorous seabirds has provided substantial evidence indicating the relevance of this hypothesis in food webs in e.g. the North Pacific, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The emergence of 'junk-food' in these systems may be coupled to large scale changes in climatological and oceanographic forcing, although predation, fishing and competition provide additional plausible hypotheses. It may be possible to predict which kinds of animals will be particularly sensitive to food quality; these seem to be species with limited ability to carry food loads, with energetically-expensive foraging behaviour, and with digestive anatomy evolved to minimize mass at the cost of digestive efficiency. This review suggests that the junk-food hypothesis is a highly relevant factor in relation to sustaining ecosystem resilience, and is an important consideration in ecosystem management. Sustaining healthy populations of marine top-predators requires an understanding of the role of food quality, in addition to food abundance and availability.  2008 The Authors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

However, at a high temperature (25 C), turbid water modulated the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity as an indicator of the redox state of the insect larvae. Antioxidant defenses require energy, and high temperature was associated with low energy reserves, which might limit the capability of organisms to counteract reactive oxygen species. Moreover, co-exposure to turbid water and high temperature caused fluctuation of antioxidant defenses and increased the oxidative damage caused by the production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the combined effect of high temperature and turbid water on antioxidant defenses and oxidative damage was larger than the individual effects. Therefore, our results demonstrate that exposure to both turbid water and high temperature generates additive and synergistic interactions causing oxidative stress in this aquatic insect species.  2018"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

A variety of measures-ANOVA, covariance, epistatic additivity, mutual information, joint cumulants, Bliss independence-exist that compute interactions across fields.

This missing framework likely contributes to the confusion about proper formulations and interpretations of higher-order interactions. Intriguingly, despite higher-order interactions having received little attention, they have been recently discovered to be highly prevalent and to likely impact the dynamics of complex biological systems. Here, we introduce a single, explicit mathematical framework that simultaneously encompasses all of these measures of pairwise interactions. The generality and simplicity of this framework allows us to establish a rigorous method for deriving higher-order interaction measures based on any of the pairwise interactions listed above. These generalized higher-order interaction measures enable the exploration of emergent phenomena across systems such as multiple predator effects, gene epistasis, and environmental stressors.

This is still the case in size-structured predator communities where predators consume prey species of different sizes (interspecific prey responses) or consume different size classes of the same species of prey (intraspecific prey responses). A mechanism has recently been proposed to explain coexistence between predators that differ in size but share the same prey species, emergent facilitation, which is dependent on strong intraspecific responses from one or more prey species. Under emergent facilitation, predators can depend on each other for invasion, persistence or success in a size-structured prey community. Experimental evidence for intraspecific size-structured responses in prey populations remains rare, and further questions remain about direct interactions between predators that could prevent or limit any positive effects between predators [e.g. intraguild predation (IGP)]. Here, we provide a community-wide experiment on emergent facilitation including natural predators. We investigate both the direct interactions between two predators that differ in body size (fish vs. invertebrate predator), and the indirect interaction between them via their shared prey community (zooplankton). Our evidence supports the most likely expectation of interactions between differently sized predators that IGP rates are high, and interspecific interactions in the shared prey community dominate the response to predation (i.e. predator-mediated competition). The question of whether emergent facilitation occurs frequently in nature requires more empirical and theoretical attention, specifically to address the likelihood that its pre-conditions may co-occur with high rates of IGP.  2014 British Ecological Society."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

We tested the predictions from different defense models in tadpoles of the common frog Rana temporaria, which exhibit both types of defenses. In an outdoor experiment, we exposed the tadpoles to nonlethal predators (Aeshna dragonfly larvae) and to a gradient of intraspecific competition. Morphological responses did not follow any of the expected patterns, since investment in defense was not affected by resource level. Instead, tail depth decreased in the absence of predators. Behavioral defenses followed a state-dependent model. Overall, the defense strategy of the tadpoles revealed a shift from morphological and behavioral defenses at low tadpole density to morphological defense only at high density. This difference probably reflects the different efficiency of the defenses. Hiding is an effective means of defense, but it is unsustainable when resources are scarce. Morphological responses become more important with increasing density to compensate for the increase in behavioral risk-taking.

Theories based on the alternative of top-down regulation have fared better. Paine's discovery of keystone predation demonstrated that the regulation of diversity via top-down forcing could be simple, strong, and direct, yet ecologists have persistently failed to perceive generality in Paine's result. Removing top predators destabilizes many systems and drives transitions to radically distinct alternative states. These transitions typically involve community reorganization and loss of diversity, implying that top-down forcing is crucial to diversity maintenance. Contrary to the expectations of bottom-up theories, many terrestrial herbivores and mesopredators are capable of sustained order-of-magnitude population increases following release from predation, negating the assumption that populations of primary consumers are resource limited and at or near carrying capacity. Predation sensu lato (to include Janzen-Connell mortality agents) has been shown to promote diversity in a wide range of ecosystems, including rocky intertidal shelves, coral reefs, the nearshore ocean, streams, lakes, temperate and tropical forests, and arctic tundra. The compelling variety of these ecosystems suggests that top-down forcing plays a universal role in regulating diversity. This conclusion is further supported by studies showing that the reduction or absence of predation leads to diversity loss and, in the more dramatic cases, to catastrophic regime change. Here, I expand on the thesis that diversity is maintained by the interaction between predation and competition, such that strong top-down forcing reduces competition, allowing coexistence."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-LABELS: review | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

In experiments conducted over 12 days (approximately 50 prey generations, but less than one predator generation). we measured a decrease in the effect of mosquito larvae predators on protozoa prey populations. In a separate set of experiments, we found that the presence of predators corresponded with evolution of smaller cell size and increased population growth rate. In ecological experiments, two situations commonly occur: strong selection pressure applied by the treatment itself and discrepancies in generation times of associate species.

Whether and how warming-induced effects on competitive interactions are modified by predation remains unknown. We hypothesized that predation will offset the competitive advantage of smaller prey species in warmer environments because of their greater vulnerability to predation. To test this, we assembled a litter arthropod community with two Collembola species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) of different body sizes across a temperature gradient (three thermal environments) and in the presence and absence of predatory mites. Predatory mites reduced Collembola coexistence with increasing temperatures. Contradicting our hypothesis, the larger prey species always outperformed the smaller prey species in warmer environments with predators. Larger prey probably benefited as they expressed a greater trait (body length) plasticity to warming. Warming can thus magnify predation effects and reduce the probability of prey coexistence.  2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Determining whether the net effect of stressors is ecologically surprising requires comparing their cumulative impact to a null model that represents the linear combination of their individual effects (i.e., an additive expectation). However, we show that standard additive and multiplicative null models that base their predictions on the effects of single stressors on community properties (e.g., species richness or biomass) do not provide this linear expectation, leading to incorrect interpretations of antagonistic and synergistic responses by communities. We present an alternative, the compositional null model, which instead bases its predictions on the effects of stressors on individual species, and then aggregates them to the community level. Simulations demonstrate the improved ability of the compositional null model to accurately provide a linear expectation of the net effect of stressors. We simulate the response of communities to paired stressors that affect species in a purely additive fashion and compare the relative abilities of the compositional null model and two standard community property null models (additive and multiplicative) to predict these linear changes in species richness and community biomass across different combinations (both positive, negative, or opposite) and intensities of stressors. The compositional model predicts the linear effects of multiple stressors under almost all scenarios, allowing for proper classification of net effects, whereas the standard null models do not. Our findings suggest that current estimates of the prevalence of ecological surprises on communities based on community property null models are unreliable, and should be improved by integrating the responses of individual species to the community level as does our compositional null model.  2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

To explain variation in impacts among studies, we propose a broad framework that separates drivers of impacts into universal and unique attributes of the invasive species and the invaded habitat. Universal attributes are relevant to all invasions whereas unique attributes are distinct to a specific invasion. For example, impacts associated with the abundance of any invader or the properties of a specific invader (e.g., a rare toxin) represent a universal and unique impact attribute. Through meta-analyses of aquatic field experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our framework, documenting that both the abundance and the taxonomic identity of the invader significantly influence invasion outcomes for marine and freshwater plant and animal invaders. Our review also highlights that many more experiments are needed to test for universal attributes, such as priority effects, age and size, and how the attributes of the invaded habitat further modify invasion impacts. We hope that our framework will stimulate experimental invasion ecology and begin to reconcile the idiosyncrasies that currently impede the development of a unified framework for invasion impacts.  2011 Elsevier Inc."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

We show that invaders, across studies, typically have negative effects on biodiversity within a trophic level but positive effects on biodiversity of higher trophic levels. For example, both plants and sessile filter-feeders had positive effects on richness and diversity of mobile consumers. The contrasting negative and positive effects on similar versus higher trophic levels are potentially manifested through community-wide antagonism (competition and consumption) versus facilitation (habitat and food provisioning) interactions, respectively. These relation ships extended to functional interactions, as sessile invaders had negative effects on the biodiversity of sessile communities (intra-functional interactions) but positive effects on the biodiversity of mobile communities (inter-functional interactions). Our analyses highlight the importance of pairing attributes of the invader and the impacted organisms to obtain simple predictions of how the diversity of entire communities may respond to species invasions on local scales.

As with later life-history switch points, plasticity in hatching timing may have carryover effects that affect subsequent interactions with predators and competitors. Moreover, the strength of such effects of hatching plasticity may be context dependent. We used red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, to test for lasting effects of hatching timing (four or six days postoviposition) under factorial combinations of resource levels (high or low) and predation risk (none, caged, or lethal Pantala flavescens dragonfly naiads). Tadpoles were raised in 400-L mesocosms in Gamboa, Panama, from hatching until all animals had metamorphosed or died, allowing assessment of effects across a nearly six-month period of metamorphosis. Hatching early reduced survival to metamorphosis, increased larval growth, and had context-dependent effects on metamorph phenotypes. Early during the period of metamorph emergence, earlyhatched animals were larger than late-hatched ones, but this effect attenuated over time. Early-hatched animals also left the water with relatively longer tails. Lethal predators dramatically reduced survival to metamorphosis, with most mortality occurring early in the larval period. Predator effects on the timing of metamorphosis and metamorph size and tail length depended upon resources. For example, lethal predators reduced larval periods, and this effect was stronger with low resources. Predators affected metamorph size early in the period of metamorphosis, whereas resource levels were a stronger determinant of phenotype for animals that metamorphosed later. Effects of hatching timing were detectable on top of strong effects of larval predators and resources, across two subsequent life stages, and some were as strong as or stronger than effects of resources. Plasticity in hatching timing is ecologically important and currently underappreciated. Effects on metamorph numbers and phenotypes may impact subsequent interactions with predators, competitors, and mates, with potentially cascading effects on recruitment and fitness.  2013 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

By alleviating interspecific competition among prey, predators may promote biodiversity, but the precise mechanisms of how predators alter competition have remained elusive. Here we report on a predator-exclosure experiment carried out in a tropical intertidal ecosystem, providing evidence for a three-level trophic cascade induced by predation by molluscivore Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that affects pore water biogeochemistry. In the exclosures the knots' favorite prey (Dosinia isocardia) became dominant and reduced the individual growth rate in an alternative prey (Loripes lucinalis). Dosinia, a suspension feeder, consumes suspended particulate organic matter (POM), whereas Loripes is a facultative mixotroph, partly living on metabolites produced by sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, but also consuming suspended POM. Reduced sulfide concentrations in the exclosures suggest that, without predation on Dosinia, stronger competition for suspended POM forces Loripes to rely on energy produced by endosymbiotic bacteria, thus leading to an enhanced uptake of sulfide from the surrounding pore water. As sulfide is toxic to most organisms, this competitioninduced diet shift by Loripes may detoxify the environment, which in turn may facilitate other species. The inference that predators affect the toxicity of their environment via a multi-level trophic cascade is novel, but we believe it may be a general phenomenon in detritus-based ecosystems.  2012 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Herbivory also varies seasonally and can affect the net outcome of plant-plant interactions, but the interactive effects of seasonality and herbivory on the competition-facilitation balance are not known. I experimentally manipulated neighboring plants and herbivory during wet and dry periods for two species of grass: Cynodon plectostachyus and Permise turn stramineum, in the semiarid Laikipia District of Kenya. These experiments indicate that Pennisetum was competitively dominant during the wet season and that it responded negatively to grazing, especially during the dry season. Cynodon showed more complex season- and herbivore-dependent responses. Cynodon experienced facilitation that was simultaneously dependent on presence of herbivores and on dry season. During the wet season Cynodon experienced net competition. These results illustrate how herbivory and seasonality can interact in complex ways to shift species-species competition-facilitation balance.

Through their effects on plant communities, herbivores can exert strong direct and indirect effects on savanna ecosystems and have the potential to create and maintain savanna landscape heterogeneity. Throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, periodic creation and abandonment of livestock corrals leads to landscape mosaics of long-term ecosystem hotspots that attract both cattle and large ungulate wildlife. 2. The development and maintenance of vegetation in these types of hotspots may be controlled in part by herbivory. Cattle and wildlife may have different, potentially contrasting effects on plant succession and plant-plant interactions. We ask how cattle and wild herbivores affect the maintenance and vegetation development of corral-derived landscape heterogeneity (0.25-1.0 ha treeless 'glades') in Laikipia, Kenya, through their effects on long-term successional and short-term plant-plant dynamics. 3. We used the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment to exclude from glades different combinations of cattle, large ungulate wildlife (i.e. zebras, gazelles and other antelopes), and mega-herbivore wildlife (i.e. giraffes and elephants). We first assessed long-term changes in cover of the dominant grass species, Cynodon plectostachyus and Pennisetum stramineum (the early- and late-dominant species, respectively). We then used a neighbour removal experiment to test the effects of different herbivores on competition and facilitation between the two glade grass species. 4. In the long-term experiment, we found that large ungulate wildlife reinforced landscape heterogeneity over time by helping maintain glades in their early C. plectostachyus-dominated form. Cattle and mega-herbivore wildlife, on the other hand, appeared to reduce the positive effects through forage preference for C. plectostachyus. 5. In the neighbour removal experiment, we found that each grass species benefited from facilitation when it was the preferred forage for the dominant grazer. Facilitation of C. plectostachyus by P. stramineum was strongest when cattle co-occurred with wildlife, whereas facilitation of P. stramineum by C. plectostachyus was strongest when cattle were absent. 6. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that different combinations of cattle and wildlife have different effects, largely via contrasting forage preferences, on the persistence of landscape heterogeneity in this savanna landscape.

This paper illustrates, with a representative example of the relationship between seed size and the effect of frugivore's gut on seed germination, that meta-analytic procedures can also be phylogenetically corrected by means of the comparative method. The conclusions obtained in the meta-analytical and phylogenetical approaches are very different. The meta-analysis revealed that the positive effects that gut passage had on seed germination increased with seed size in the case of gut passage through birds whereas decreased in the case of gut passage through non-flying mammals. However, once the phylogenetic relatedness among plant species was taken into account, the effects of gut passage on seed germination did not depend on seed size and were similar between birds and non-flying mammals. Some methodological considerations are given to improve the bridge between the meta-analysis and the comparative method."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

In this review, meta-analysis was used to analyze experiments on giving-up-densities in terrestrial systems to evaluate the overall magnitude of predation risk on foraging behavior and experimental conditions mediating its effect. Results indicate a large and significant decrease in foraging effort as a consequence of increased predation risk. Whether experiments were conducted under natural or artificial conditions produced no change in the overall effect predation had on foraging. Odor and live predators as a correlate of predation risk had weaker and nonsignificant effects compared to habitat characteristics. The meta-analysis suggests that the effect of predation risk on foraging behavior in terrestrial systems is strongly dependent on the type of predation risk being utilized.

However, the relationship between the fitness components of different life stages may be complex. Ontogenetic switch points such as hatching and metamorphosis do not represent new beginnings - carryover effects across stages can arise when environmental effects on the density and/or traits of early ontogenetic stages subsequently alter mortality or growth in later stages. In this study, I examine the effects of egg- and larval-stage predators on larval performance, size at metamorphosis, and post-metamorphic predation in the African tree frog Hyperolius spinigularis. I monitored the density and survival of arboreal H. spinigularis clutches in the field to estimate how much egg-stage predation reduced the input of tadpoles into the pond. I then conducted experiments to determine: (1) how reductions in initial larval density due to egg predators affect larval survival and mass and age at metamorphosis in the presence and absence of aquatic larval predators, dragonfly larvae, and (2) how differences in mass or age at metamorphosis arising from predation in the embryonic and larval environments affect encounters with post-metamorphic predators, fishing spiders. Reduction in larval densities due to egg predation tended to increase per capita larval survival, decrease larval duration and increase mass at metamorphosis. Larval predators decreased larval survival and had density-dependent effects on larval duration and mass at metamorphosis. The combined effects of embryonic and larval-stage predators increased mass at metamorphosis of survivors by 91%. Larger mass at metamorphosis may have immediate fitness benefits, as larger metamorphs had higher survival in encounters with fishing spiders. Thus, the effects of predators early in ontogeny can alter predation risk even two life stages later.

These organisms, which include many thousands of species of fungi and nematodes, shape aboveground plant and animal life as well as our climate and atmosphere. Indeed, all terrestrial ecosystems consist of interdependent aboveground and belowground compartments. Despite this, aboveground and belowground ecology have been conducted largely in isolation. This book represents the first major synthesis to focus explicitly on the connections between aboveground and belowground subsystems--and their importance for community structure and ecosystem functioning. David Wardle integrates a vast body of literature from numerous fields--including population ecology, ecosystem ecology, ecophysiology, ecological theory, soil science, and global-change biology--to explain the key conceptual issues relating to how aboveground and belowground communities affect one another and the processes that each component carries out. He then applies these concepts to a host of critical questions, including the regulation and function of biodiversity as well as the consequences of human-induced global change in the form of biological invasions, extinctions, atmospheric carbon-dioxide enrichment, nitrogen deposition, land-use change, and global warming. Through ambitious theoretical synthesis and a tremendous range of examples, Wardle shows that the key biotic drivers of community and ecosystem properties involve linkages between aboveground and belowground food webs, biotic interaction, the spatial and temporal dynamics of component organisms, and, ultimately, the ecophysiological traits of those organisms that emerge as ecological drivers. His conclusions will propel theoretical and empirical work throughout ecology.  2002 by Princeton University Press.

Among different categories of response variables measured, parasites significantly affected clutch size, hatching success, young produced, and survival, but not overall breeding success. A meta-regression of effect sizes and life-history traits thought to determine parasite virulence indicate that average host life span may be the single most important driver for understanding the effects of parasites.

Here I report results of a pond mesocosm experiment where consumer (snail) species richness, predation intensity, and nutrient availability were crossed in a full-factorial design. This design allowed a direct comparison of the strength of the different factors on food web properties and ecosystem functioning (i.e., system-level fluxes of energy or matter), and an evaluation of how the factors may interact. Systems with higher snail species richness had greater secondary production, consumer biomass, ecosystem respiration, and macrophyte stem growth, and lower epiphyton and periphyton biomass. However, snail species richness effects on periphyton and epiphyton were context dependent; predators reduced the effect of increasing snail richness on the biomass of attached algae. Species richness effects were most often the result of a biological mechanism (e.g., differential resource use), rather than being solely artifacts of the experimental design (e.g., sampling effects). The effects of nutrient enrichment and predation were mostly predictable from simple food chain models; increases in nutrient availability led to increased algal biomass, primary production, and snail biomass, while predators decreased snail biomass and indirectly augmented algae. Snail species richness effects on the biomass of many functional groups were as strong or stronger than those of a substantial nutrient enrichment or of the addition of a voracious predator (Belostoma flumineum). Nutrient enrichment had the most pronounced effects on several system-level processes (e.g., primary production, sedimentation). Species richness had weaker effects on ecosystem properties than on particular functional groups, probably because of compensatory responses among different producer functional groups. In summary, this experiment suggests that the number of consumer species in a system can have large and meaningful effects on the distribution of biomass in a food web, and that these effects can depend on ecological context.  2005 by the Ecological Society of America."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Two largely separate groups of ecologists have emphasized the importance of productivity or resource supply, and consumers or physical disturbance, respectively. These variables show unimodal relationships with diversity when manipulated in isolation. Recent multivariate models, however, predict that these factors interact, such that the disturbance-diversity relationship depends on productivity, and vice versa. We tested these models in marine food webs, using field manipulations of nutrient resources and consumer pressure on rocky shores of contrasting productivity. Here we show that the effects of consumers and nutrients on diversity consistently depend on each other, and that the direction of their effects and peak diversity shift between sites of low and high productivity. Factorial meta-analysis of published experiments confirms these results across widely varying aquatic communities. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that these patterns extend to important ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and nitrogen retention. This suggests that human impacts on nutrient supply and food-web structure have strong and inter-dependent effects on species diversity and ecosystem functioning, and must therefore be managed together."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

Understanding when and why the loss of a predator causes large changes in community structure and ecosystem processes is critical for understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss. We used experimental microbial communities to investigate how the removal of a large generalist predator affected the extinction frequency, population abundance and total biomass of its prey. We removed this predator in the presence or absence of an alternative, more specialist, predator in order to determine whether the specialist predator affected the outcome of the initial species removal. Removal of the large generalist predator altered some species' populations but many were unaffected and no secondary extinctions were observed. The specialist predator, though rare, altered the response of the prey community to the removal of the large generalist predator. In the absence of the specialist predator, the effects of the removal were only measurable at the level of individual species. However, when the specialist predator was present, the removal of the large generalist predator affected the total biomass of prey species. The results demonstrate that the effect of species loss from high trophic levels may be very context-dependent, as rare species can have disproportionately large effects in food webs."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

The goal of our study is to search, by means of metaanalysis, for a general pattern in responses of herbivores, and plant characteristics important for herbivores, to simultaneous experimental increase of carbon dioxide and temperature (ECET) in comparison with both ambient conditions and responses to elevated CO2 (EC) and temperature (ET) applied separately. Our database includes 42 papers describing studies of 31 plant species and seven herbivore species. Nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio in plants decreased under both EC and ECET treatments, whereas ET had no significant effect. Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and phenolics increased in EC, decreased in ET and did not change in ECET treatments, whereas terpenes did not respond to EC but increased in both ET and ECET; leaf toughness increased in both EC and ECET. Responses of defensive secondary compounds to treatments differed between woody and green tissues as well as between gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Insect herbivore performance was adversely affected by EC, favoured by ET, and not modified by ECET. Our analysis allowed to distinguish three types of relationships between CO2 and temperature elevation: (1) responses to EC do not depend on temperature (nitrogen, C/N, leaf toughness, phenolics in angiosperm leaves), (2) responses to EC are mitigated by ET (sugars and starch, terpenes in needles of gymnosperms, insect performance) and (3) effects emerge only under ECET (nitrogen in gymnosperms, and phenolics and terpenes in woody tissues). This result indicates that conclusions of CO2 elevation studies cannot be directly extrapolated to a more realistic climate change scenario. The predicted negative effects of CO2 elevation on herbivores are likely to be mitigated by temperature increase."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

The main treatments were: two nitrogen levels (NO = 0 mg N pot(-1), N1 = 60 mg N pot(-1)), two defoliation intensities (removing 60\% of total aboveground biomass and no defoliation), and three competitive replacement series (monocultures of each species and mixtures at 0.5:0.5). Our results were inconsistent with our hypothesis on the adaptive mechanisms of A. frigida regarding the interactive effects of herbivory, N, and competition in determining its dominant position on overgrazed sites. Cleistogenes squarrosa will be replaced by A. frigida on over-grazed sites, although C. squarrosa had higher tolerance to defoliation than did A. frigida. Total biomass and N yield and N-15 recovery of C. squarrosa in mixed culture were consistently lower than in monocultures, whereas those of A. frigida grown in mixtures were consistently higher than in monocultures, suggesting higher competitive ability of A. frigida. Our results suggest that interspecific competitive ability may be of equal or greater importance than herbivory tolerance in determining herbivore-induced species replacement in semi-arid Inner Mongolian steppe. In addition, the dominance of A. frigida on overgrazed sites has been attributed to its ability to shift plant-plant interactions through (lap colonization, root niche differentiation, and higher resistance to water stress."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Detractors respond that this argument assumes an overly stringent definition of laws of nature. Under a more relaxed conception, it is argued that ecological laws emerge at the level of communities and elsewhere. A brief review of this debate reveals an issue with deep philosophical roots that is unlikely to be resolved by a better understanding of generalizations in ecology. We therefore propose a strategy for transforming the conceptual question about the nature of ecological laws into a set of empirically tractable hypotheses about the relative resilience of ecological generalizations across three dimensions: taxonomy, habitat type, and scale. These hypotheses are tested using a survey of 240 meta-analyses in ecology. Our central finding is that generalizations in community ecology are just as prevalent and as resilient as those in population or ecosystem ecology. These findings should help to establish community ecology as a generality-seeking science as opposed to a science of case studies. It also supports the capacity for ecologists, working at any of the three levels, to inform matters of public policy."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"

However, great controversy still exists regarding the change in direction and magnitudes of spring-summer phenology. Based on a large number (11,000+ records) of long-term and continuous ground observational data for various plant species, our study intended to more comprehensively assess the changing trends of spring-summer phenology and their relationships with climatic change across the QTP. The results indicated a continuous advancement (-2.69 days decade(-1)) in spring-summer phenology from 1981 to 2011, with an even more rapid advancement during 2000-2011 (-3.13 days decade-1), which provided new field evidence for continuous advancement in spring-summer phenology across the QTP. However, diverse advancing rates in spring-summer phenology were observed for different vegetation types, thermal conditions, and seasons. The advancing trends matched well with the difference in sensitivity of spring-summer phenology to increasing temperature, implying that the sensitivity of phenology to temperature was one of the major factors influencing spring-summer phenology shifts. Besides, increased precipitation could advance the spring-summer phenology. The response of spring-summer phenology to temperature tended to be stronger from east to west across all species, while the response to precipitation showed no consistent spatial pattern.

Likewise, plant genetic variation and associated trait differences can impact both plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions individually, yet few studies have explored these interactions simultaneously. 2. Saltmarsh communities are an ideal system to study these questions, as they are dominated along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States by a foundation plant species, Spartina alterniflora, with high levels of genetically based trait variation. Furthermore, consumer pressure and plant competitors are known to influence both the distribution and production of Spartina. We manipulated Spartina genetic identity, neighbour identity (needlerush, Juncus roemerianus) and consumer presence (snail, Littoraria irrorata) in a 1-year field experiment in St. Joseph Bay, FL, to test how the strength and direction of neighbour and consumer interactions vary by plant genotype. 3. Consumer effects on Spartina were generally stronger and more variable than those of the plant neighbourhood, and these effects were generally consistent across Spartina genotypes. However, genotype-specific variation in morphology, phenology and palatability significantly influenced both consumer and neighbour responses to Spartina: the consumer Littoraria was more likely to climb palatable Spartina genotypes, and neighbouring Juncus had shorter stems in the presence of highly productive Spartina genotypes. 4. Synthesis. Our results add to the growing list of examples high-lighting the role of intraspecific variation in species interactions and suggest that variation in these interactions may promote the maintenance of plant genetic variation and community composition."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not meta-analysis"

Our results suggested that (1) terrestrial P pools showed the most sensitive responses to the individual effects of warming and P addition; (2) P pools were consistently stimulated by P addition alone or in combination with simultaneous N addition; (3) environmental and experimental setting factors such as ecosystem type, climate, and latitude could significantly influence both the individual and combined effects; and (4) the interactive effects of two driver pairs across multiple global change drivers are more likely to be additive rather than synergistic or antagonistic. Our findings highlighting the importance of additive interactive effects among multiple global change drivers on terrestrial P pools would be useful for incorporating P as controls on ecological processes such as photosynthesis and plant growth into ecosystem models used to analyze effects of multiple drivers under future global change.

Biological sciences,,284,,NA,"MP, Thakur and T, Kunne and JN, Griffin and N, Eisenhauer",10.1098/rspb.2016.2570,,,,"Climate warming can destabilize interactions between competitors as smaller organisms gain advantages in warmer environments. Whether and how warming-induced effects on competitive interactions are modified by predation remains unknown. We hypothesized that predation will offset the competitive advantage of smaller prey species in warmer environments because of their greater vulnerability to predation. To test this, we assembled a litter arthropod community with two Collembola species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) of different body sizes across a temperature gradient (three thermal environments) and in the presence and absence of predatory mites. Predatory mites reduced Collembola coexistence with increasing temperatures. Contradicting our hypothesis, the larger prey species always outperformed the smaller prey species in warmer environments with predators. Larger prey probably benefited as they expressed a greater trait (body length) plasticity to warming. Warming can thus magnify predation effects and reduce the probability of prey coexistence."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>false} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate,not meta-analysis"
Yang20052083,Effects of zooplankton grazing on colony formation in algae: A review,2005,1,1,Acta Ecologica Sinica,,25,,2083-2089,"Yang, Z. and Kong, F.-X.",NA,,,,"In order to understand the mechanisms of bloom formation in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), we reviewed the literature on inducing effects of grazing pressure of zooplankton on colony formation in algae. These published studies demonstrated that effect of colony-inducing compounds released by herbivorous zooplankton is a key factor in colony formation of algae. The inducing chemicals are not the functional constituents of the organisms involved but the result of the interaction between species. Probably two different mechanisms are involved in the colony formation. One mechanism such as in Scenedesmus spp., is that colonies are formed when daughter cells of a recently divided cell fail to separate during reproduction, the other is that colonies are formed through adhesion of already existing single cells, such as in Microcystis aeruginosa. Because a high proportion of colonies could significantly reduce the grazing rate of zooplankton, algal colony formation may be interpreted as an induced defense strategy against grazing to pare down mortality due to animal grazing. If colony formation in cyanobacteria is induced by the grazing pressure in eutrophic waters then visible blooms will occur when colonies accumulate to certain magnitudes under favorable hydrometeorological conditions. It is therefore important to conduct research on the early stage of colony formation in cyanobacteria induced by grazing pressure of herbivorous zooplankton to understand the bloom formation and to provide insights into the adaptive mechanisms of inducing defense against grazing in algae as one of the complex interactions among organisms in aquatic ecosystems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>true}"
