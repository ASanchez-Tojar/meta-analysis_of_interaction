abstract={Because many of the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine life may result from underlying energetic short-falls associated with increased metabolic demands, several studies have hypothesized that negative responses to high CO2 could be reduced by energy input. Although this hypothesis was supported by a recent meta-analysis, we believe that the meta-analytic calculation used was not appropriate to test the stated hypothesis. Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and CO2 interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive effect and CO2 has a negative effect on both growth and calcification. For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO2 impacts. Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope upon which CO2 effects can act in food-replete situations. These interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic approach. Ongoing changes in food supply and carbonate chemistry, coupled with under-described, poorly understood, and potentially surprising interactive outcomes for these two variables, suggest that the role of food should remain a priority in ocean acidification research.

abstract={Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is thought to promote plant species diversity. Theoretical studies showing the importance of CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD; however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly in their susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on diversity. First, if the most common species are the least regulated by CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible to CNDD are at a competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the competitive inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may undermine many species’ ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests that variable CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more stable. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

We conducted an 11-yr field experiment to test the prediction that large grazers affect selection on floral display of the dimorphic herb Primula farinosa not only directly through differential grazing damage, but also indirectly by affecting vegetation height and thereby selection mediated by pollinators and seed predators. Exclusion of large grazers increased vegetation height and the strength of pollinator-mediated selection for tall inflorescences and seed-predator-mediated selection for short inflorescences. The direct effect of grazers on selection resulting from differential grazing damage to the two scape morphs showed no temporal trend. By contrast, the increase in vegetation height in exclosures over time was associated with an increase in selection mediated by pollinators and seed predators. In the early years of the experiment, the indirect effects of grazers on selection mediated by pollinators and seed predators were weak, whereas at the end of the experiment, the indirect effects were of similar magnitude as the direct effect due to differential grazing damage. The results demonstrate that the indirect effects of a selective agent can be as strong as its direct effects, and that the relative importance of direct vs. indirect effects on selection can change over time. A full understanding of the ecological processes governing variation in selection thus requires that both direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions are assessed. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Plants face a range of trade-offs as they attempt to maximize their fitness within a complex web composed of competitors, mutualists, and herbivores. In addition to growth–defense and competition–defense trade-offs, plants must balance their response to a wide range of potential enemies including pathogens and vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. We tested for trade-offs in plant species’ responses to different types of consumers using a foodweb manipulation experiment in which we selectively excluded large vertebrate herbivores and removed foliar fungi, soil fungi, and insects from natural and experimentally planted grassland communities. We found no evidence for trade-offs in the ability of plants to defend themselves against different sets of consumers, although plants varied widely in their responses to removal of different consumer groups. In addition, the species-level responses to consumer removal in monoculture were uncorrelated with each species’ response in more diverse communities, highlighting the important role of local context (e.g., competition and apparent competition) in determining the effects of consumers. Plants must balance their allocation of energy among a wide variety of tasks including growing, competing for limited resources, and defending themselves against an array of potential enemies. We found that while plant species differed greatly in their response to the removal of consumers, species that were susceptible to the effects of one consumer group (e.g., insect herbivores) also were susceptible to other consumer groups (e.g., fungal pathogens). This suggests that plants differ in their overall allocation to defense, but defense investment can proffer protection against a wide array of natural enemies. We also found that plant responses to consumers depended on the diversity of the surrounding plant community, suggesting that among-plant interactions can alter their susceptibility to the impacts of consumers. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Mutualists may play an important role in invasion success. The ability to take advantage of novel mutualists or survive and reproduce despite a lack of mutualists may facilitate invasion by those individuals with such traits. Here, we used two greenhouse studies to examine how soil microbial communities in general and mutualistic rhizobia in particular affect the performance of a legume species (Medicago polymorpha) that has invaded five continents. We performed two plant growth experiments with Medicago polymorpha, inoculating them with soil slurries in one experiment or rhizobial cultures in another experiment. For both experiments, we compared the growth of Medicago in competition with conspecific or heterospecific plants and examined variation among plant genotypes collected from the native and introduced ranges. We found that all genotypes experienced similar increases in biomass and formed more nodules that house rhizobia bacteria when inoculated with soil from a previously invaded site, compared to uninoculated plants or plants inoculated with soil from uninvaded and low invasion sites. In a second experiment, plants inoculated with rhizobia generally produced more biomass, had greater tolerance to interspecific competition, and had greater effects on competitor biomass than uninoculated plants. However, plant genotypes collected from the native range benefited more from rhizobia and were less tolerant of competition relative to genotypes collected from the introduced range. In the introduced range, compatible mutualists may not be readily available but competition is intense, causing Medicago to evolve to benefit less from interactions with rhizobia mutualists, while simultaneously becoming more tolerant of competition. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Forests make up a large portion of terrestrial plant biomass, and the long-lived woody plants that dominate them possess an array of traits that deter consumption by forest pests. Although often extremely effective against native consumers, invasive species that avoid or overcome these defenses can wreak havoc on trees and surrounding ecosystems. This is especially true when multiple invasive species co-occur, since interactions between invasive herbivores may yield non-additive effects on the host. While the threat posed by invasive forest pests is well known, long-term field experiments are necessary to explore these consumer-host interactions at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, it is important to measure multiple variables to get a “whole-plant” picture of their combined impact. We report the results of a 4-yr field experiment addressing the individual and combined impacts of two invasive herbivores, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa), on native eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in southern New England. In 2011, we planted 200 hemlock saplings into a temperate forest understory and experimentally manipulated the presence/absence of both herbivore species; in 2015, we harvested the 88 remaining saplings and assessed plant physiology, growth, and resource allocation. Adelgids strongly affected hemlock growth: infested saplings had lower above/belowground biomass ratios, more needle loss, and produced fewer new needles than control saplings. Hemlock scale did not alter plant biomass allocation or growth, and its co-occurrence did not alter the impact of adelgid. While both adelgid and scale impacted the concentrations of primary metabolites, adelgid effects were more pronounced. Adelgid feeding simultaneously increased free amino acids local to feeding sites and a ~30% reduction in starch. The cumulative impact of adelgid-induced needle loss, manipulation of nitrogen pools, and the loss of stored resources likely accelerates host decline through disruption of homeostatic source-sink dynamics occurring at the whole-plant level. Our research stresses the importance of considering long-term impacts to predict how plants will cope with contemporary pressures experienced in disturbed forests. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Plants interact simultaneously with each other and with soil biota, yet the relative importance of competition vs. plant–soil feedback (PSF) on plant performance is poorly understood. Using a meta-analysis of 38 published studies and 150 plant species, we show that effects of interspecific competition (either growing plants with a competitor or singly, or comparing inter- vs. intraspecific competition) and PSF (comparing home vs. away soil, live vs. sterile soil, or control vs. fungicide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly negative, broadly comparable in magnitude, and additive or synergistic. Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific competition), suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indicating that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our understanding of how these biotic interactions influence community structure. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract={Premise of the Study: Organisms engage in multiple species interactions simultaneously. While pollination studies generally focus on plants and pollinators exclusively, secondary robbing, a behavior that requires other species (primary robbers) to first create access holes in corollas, is common. It has been shown that secondary robbing can reduce plants' female fitness; however, we lack knowledge about its impact on male plant fitness. Methods: We experimentally simulated primary and secondary robbing in the monocarpic perennial Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae), quantifying indirect effects on pollinator-mediated pollen (dye) donation. We also assessed whether continual nectar removal via the floral opening has similar effects on hummingbird-pollinator behavior as continual secondary robbing through robber holes. Key Results: We found no significant indirect effects of secondary robbing on a component of Ipomopsis male fitness. Although robbing did reduce pollen (dye) donation due to avoidance of robbed plants by pollinating hummingbirds, pollen donation did not differ between the two robbing treatments. The effects of secondary robbing on hummingbird behavior resembled effects of chronic nectar removal by pollinators. Our results indicate that hummingbird pollinators may use a combination of cues, including cues given by the presence or absence of nectar, to make foraging decisions. Conclusions: Combined with prior research, this study suggests that secondary robbing is less costly to a component of male fitness than to female fitness in Ipomopsis, broadening our knowledge of the overall costs of mutualism exploitation to total plant fitness. © 2018 Botanical Society of America},

abstract={We tested whether the recently proposed two-part measure of degree of invasion (DI) of a community relating exotic proportion of cover to exotic proportion of richness can characterize patterns of plant invasions at multiple savannah sites in Southern Africa. Regression analysis was performed on transformed data to assess how this two-part measure of DI compares to other metrics of community invasibility. The results indicate that at the plot level, the absolute cover of exotics was not significantly related to native cover for three sites out of four assessed (R2 ≤ 0.17; P &gt; 0.05). Also, at all four sites, no significant relationships were detected between native and exotic plant richness at both the 1-m2 and 400-m2 plot scales. By contrast, significant (P &lt; 0.05) positive linear relationships were observed between exotic proportion of richness and exotic proportion of cover at all sites (R2 was as high as 0.67 and 0.97 for two sites). Our results indicate that the new two-part measure of DI is able to characterize patterns of plant invasions across plant communities in African savannahs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Plant–soil feedback (PSF) has been identified as a key driver of local plant diversity and evenness in competitive communities. However, while it has been shown that spatial PSF heterogeneity can alter plant performance and competitive interactions, there is no proof of principle that spatial PSF heterogeneity enhances community diversity. Using a grassland model system, we separated two aspects of spatial heterogeneity: the number of species conditioning the soil and spatial distribution of the PSFs. Our data show that PSFs promoted a higher plant evenness when the soil was conditioned by multiple species (mixed-conditioned) than when the soil was conditioned by a single species (mono-conditioned). On mono-conditioned soils, heterospecifics typically outperformed the focal species. In addition, there was a trend for increasing community evenness from uniform, via fine-grained to coarse-grained mixed-conditioned soils, but this was not significant. On mixed-conditioned soils, performance of all competing species was intermediate to the best and the worst mono-conditioned soils, leading to higher community evenness. Our data demonstrate that PSFs play a role in promoting plant evenness. Across mono-conditioned soils, PSF led to altered competitive hierarchies. However, on soils conditioned by multiple species, competitive ability among species was more similar and this led to higher plant evenness. The spatial distribution of the heterogeneity, on the other hand, did not significantly affect plant evenness. Our data therefore show that community evenness was more strongly related to the number of plant species that conditioned the soil than the spatial distribution of the PSF heterogeneity. Future studies need to investigate the importance of PSFs in the field across plant life stages and multiple generations. A plain language summary is available for this article. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Reductions in community evenness can lead to local extinctions as dominant species exclude subordinate species; however, herbivores can prevent competitive exclusion by consuming otherwise dominant plant species, thus increasing evenness. While these predictions logically result from chronic, gradual reductions in evenness, rapid, temporary pulses of dominance may also reduce species richness. Short pulses of dominance can occur as biotic or abiotic conditions temporarily favour one or a few species, manifested as increased temporal variability (the inverse of temporal stability) in community evenness. Here, we tested whether consumers help maintain plant diversity by reducing the temporal variability in community evenness. We tested our hypothesis by reducing herbivore abundance in a detailed study of a developing, tallgrass prairie restoration. To assess the broader implications of the importance of herbivory on community evenness as well as potential mechanisms, we paired this study with a global herbivore reduction experiment. We found that herbivores maintained plant richness in a tallgrass prairie restoration by limiting temporary pulses in dominance by a single species. Dominance by an annual species in a single year was negatively associated with species richness, suggesting that short pulses of dominance may be sufficient to exclude subordinate species. The generality of this site-level relationship was supported by the global experiment in which inter-annual variability in evenness declined in the presence of vertebrate herbivores over timeframes ranging in length from 2 to 5 years, preventing declines in species richness. Furthermore, inter-annual variability of community evenness was also negatively associated with pre-treatment species richness. Synthesis. A loss or reduction of herbivores can destabilize plant communities by allowing brief periods of dominance by one or a few species, potentially triggering a feedback cycle of dominance and extinction. Such cycles may not occur immediately following the loss of herbivores, being delayed until conditions allow temporary periods of dominance by a subset of plant species. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Plants influence associated soil biotic communities that in turn can alter the performance of the subsequently growing plants. Although such “plant–soil feedbacks” (PSFs) are considered as important drivers of plant community assembly, past PSF studies have mainly addressed plant biomass production. However, plant performance is not only the production of biomass but comprises a sequence of different life stages: from seed germination over vegetative growth up to the production of a viable progeny. Here, we assessed the effects of soil biotic communities that were previously conditioned for 3 years by a focal plant species monoculture or species mixtures on key plant life stages from germination and vegetative growth to flowering and the production of viable seeds. We used three common grassland herb species that were grown in a sterile substrate and inoculated with a sterile control soil or with living soils. Living soils were conditioned either by the focal species in monoculture or a four- or eight-species mixture that included the focal species to represent a decrease in the target plants’ conspecific influence on the soil communities. We show that the effect of soil biota changed from positive at the plants’ juvenile life stages to neutral or negative at the plants’ adult life stages and ultimately decreased plant fitness. A higher conspecific influence on the soil communities pronounced the positive effects at the juvenile life stage but also the negative effects at adult life stages. Further, we observed direct soil biotic effects on flower production and plant fitness that were not mediated by adult biomass production. This suggests that soil biotic effects may alter plant resource allocation and even may have transgenerational effects on plant fitness. Synthesis. We conclude that there is no overarching effect of soil biota that remains consistent at all the life stages of a plant. Thus, our results highlight the importance to consider plant life stage and ultimately plant fitness especially when plant–soil interactions are used to explain plant community dynamics. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Premise of the Study: Plants often interact simultaneously with multiple antagonists and mutualists that can alter plant traits at the phenotypic or genetic level, subsequent plant–insect interactions, and reproduction. Although many studies have examined the effects of single floral antagonisms on subsequent pollination and plant reproduction, we know very little about the combined, potentially non-additive effects of multiple flower–insect interactions. Methods: We simulated increased florivory, nectar robbing, and pollination on field-grown Impatiens capensis, which allowed us to determine interactive effects on five subsequent plant–insect interactions and 16 plant traits, including traits related to plant growth, floral attractiveness, floral defenses, and plant reproduction. Key Results: All three manipulative treatments had significant non-additive effects on the behavior of subsequent floral visitors, indicating that the effect of floral visitors generally depended on the presence or behavior of others. Pollination increased visitation by both pollinators and nectar larcenists (robbers and thieves), while florivory reduced pollinator and larcenist visits. Surprisingly, supplemental pollination also increased leaf herbivory. Florivores often responded to manipulations in opposite ways than did nectar larcenists and pollinators, suggesting different mechanisms influencing visitors that consume nectar compared to floral tissue. While our treatments did not affect any floral trait measured, they non-additively impacted plant reproduction, with florivory having a larger overall impact than either nectar robbing or pollination. Conclusions: These results emphasize the importance of understanding the context in which flower–insect interactions occur because the composition of the interacting community can have large and non-additive impacts on subsequent insect behavior and plant reproduction. © 2018 Botanical Society of America},

abstract={Plants engage in complex multipartite interactions with mutualists and antagonists, but these interactions are rarely included in studies that explore plant invasiveness. When considered in isolation, we know that beneficial microbes can enhance an exotic plant’s invasive ability and that herbivorous insects often decrease an exotic plant’s likeliness of success. However, the effect of these partners on plant fitness has not been well characterized when all three species coevolve. We use computational evolutionary modeling of a trait-based system to test how microbes and herbivores simultaneously coevolving with an invading plant affect the invaders’ probability of becoming established. Specifically, we designed a model that explores how a beneficial microbe would influence the outcome of an interaction between a plant and herbivore. To model novel interactions, we included a phenotypic trait shared by each species. Making this trait continuous and selectable allows us to explore how trait similarities between coevolving plants, herbivores and microbes affect fitness. Using this model, we answer the following questions: (1) Can a beneficial plant-microbe interaction influence the evolutionary outcome of antagonistic interactions between plants and herbivores? (2) How does the initial trait similarity between interacting organisms affect the likelihood of plant survival in novel locations? (3) Does the effect of tripartite interactions on the invasion success of a plant depend on whether organisms interact through trait similarity [Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)] or dissimilarity (Biotic Resistance Hypothesis)? We found that it was much more difficult for plants to invade under the ERH but that beneficial microbes increase the probability of plant survival in a novel range under both hypotheses. To our knowledge, this model is the first to use tripartite interactions to explore novel species introductions. It represents a step towards gaining a better understanding of the factors influencing establishment of exotic species to prevent future invasions. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Plant community productivity commonly increases with increasing plant diversity, which is explained by complementarity among plant species in resource utilization (complementarity effect), or by selection of particularly productive plant species in diverse plant communities (selection effect). Recent studies have also shown that soil biota can drive the positive plant diversity–productivity relationship by suppressing productivity more in low- than in high-diversity plant communities. However, much remains unknown about whether soil fertility plays a role in determining how soil biota affect plant diversity–productivity relationships. We hypothesized that under high soil fertility conditions, negative soil biota effects dominate, which reduces plant monoculture biomass more than that of high-diversity plant communities. Conversely, under low soil fertility conditions, we hypothesized positive soil biota effects dominate, which facilitates plant resource partitioning and enhances community-level biomass in high-diversity plant communities. Hence, we expected positive plant diversity–community productivity relationships under low and high soil fertility conditions but caused by different mechanisms. We tested these hypotheses using woody seedlings and set up plant assemblages with four species richness levels (one, two, four and eight species), and grew them in sterilized and unsterilized (sterilized soil + living soil inoculum) soils at two nutrient levels (low versus high fertility). We found that at high fertility negative soil biota effects dominated and suppressed plant community biomass more in high-diversity plant communities than in monocultures, resulting in reduced complementarity effects of diverse plant communities and a non-significant plant species richness–community biomass relationship in unsterilized soil. Whereas at low fertility soil biota had net neutral to positive effects on plant community biomass but the beneficial effects did not increase with increasing plant species richness. Instead, soil biota neutrally affected the positive plant species richness–community biomass relationship, presumably due to non-specific effects of beneficial soil biota. Synthesis. Soil biota and soil fertility interactively determine plant species richness–community biomass relationships. Moreover, soil biota modulate the complementary resource use among plant species. These findings suggest that environmental context plays an important role in determining whether and how soil biota generate the biodiversity–productivity relationship. Future studies would benefit from revealing the mechanisms underlying the interactive effects of soil biota, soil fertility, and plant diversity on ecosystem functioning. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Theory predicts that contrasting properties of mutualistic and antagonistic networks differentially promote community resilience to species loss. However, the outcome of most ecological interactions falls within a continuum between mutualism and antagonism, and we ignore the extent to which this interactions' continuum might influence community stability. Using a large data set of interactions, we compared co-extinction cascades that either consider or ignore the mix of beneficial and detrimental actions that parrots exert on plants. When the antagonism-mutualism continuum was considered, a combination of the properties that separately enhance community stability in ecological networks emerged. This combination of properties led to an overall increase of the parrot community robustness to face plant species loss. Our results highlight that the conditional outcomes of interactions can influence the structure of ecological networks, thus affecting our predictions of community stability against eventual changes. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The sum of fruit and seed predation by multiple species may strongly affect plant reproduction and population dynamics. We evaluated the combined effects of ungulates, seed-eating rodents and insect pre-dispersal seed predators on the reproductive success of the Mediterranean gum cistus shrub (Cistus ladanifer), over two consecutive years within a long-term ungulate-exclusion experiment. We compared fruiting success in shrubs exposed and protected from ungulates by examining fruit abortion and fruit production. We also investigated the effect of insect predation on seed production (i.e. proportion of depredated fruit and seed loss) and measured fruit weight, seed number per fruit, and seed weight of unpredated fruits. Ungulate browsing directly removed 42.3% of the plant reproductive structures, early in the reproductive season and insect predation reduced mature seeds by over 40%. Results also emphasize the additive effects of ungulate browsing on pre-dispersal insect predation and fruit abortion which increased by 74.7% and 60.9%, respectively. Rodents, which only occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, had a limited and later effect on seed production with 6% of mature fruit loss. Fruit weight, seed weight and number were higher in shrubs protected from ungulates. Our study indicated that seed predation by mice was irrelevant, but ungulate and invertebrate seed predation interacted to strongly limit the reproductive success of C ladanifer, potentially affecting plant population dynamics in the long-term. © 2017 Gesellschaft für Ökologie},

abstract={Extensive empirical work has demonstrated local adaptation to discrete environments, yet few studies have elucidated the genetic and environment mechanisms that generate it. Here, we advocate for research that broadens our understanding of local adaptation beyond pattern and towards process. We discuss how studies of local adaptation can be designed to address two unresolved questions in evolutionary ecology: Does local adaptation result from fitness trade-offs at individual loci across habitats? How do agents of selection interact to generate local adaptation to discrete contrasting habitats types and continuous environmental gradients? To inform future investigations of the genetic basis of local adaptation, we conducted a literature review of studies that mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness in native field environments using reciprocal transplant experiments with hybrid mapping populations or Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) panels. We then reviewed the literature for field experiments that disentangle the contributions of various agents of selection to local adaptation. For each question, we suggest future lines of inquiry and discuss implications for climate change and agriculture research. (i) Studies in the native habitats of five biological systems revealed that local adaptation is more often caused by conditional neutrality than genetic trade-offs at the level of the QTL. We consider the ramifications of this result and discuss knowledge gaps in our current understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation. (ii) We uncovered only five studies that identified the agents of selection that contribute to local adaptation, and nearly all were conducted in discrete habitats rather than across the continuous environmental gradients that many species inhabit. We introduce a novel experimental framework for illuminating the processes underlying local adaptation. A holistic view of local adaptation is critical for predicting the responses of organisms to climate change, enhancing conservation efforts, and developing strategies to improve crop resilience to environmental stress. Experiments that manipulate agents of selection in native field environments using pedigreed populations or GWAS panels offer unique opportunities for detecting the genetic and environmental mechanisms that generate local adaptation. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Recent evidence suggests that plant performance can be influenced by the phylogenetic diversity of neighboring plants. However, no study to date has examined the effect of such phylogenetic density dependence on the transition from seed to seedling. Using 6 years of data on seedling recruitment and seed rain of 13 species from 130 stations (one 0.5 m2 seed trap and three adjacent 1 m2 seedling plots) in a subtropical evergreen forest, we asked: (1) Does negative density dependence act across seed to seedling stages? (2) Is there evidence for phylogenetic density dependence during the seed to seedling transition? (3) Does the strength of density dependence vary among years? Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to model seed to seedling transition as a function of conspecific seed and seedling densities, heterospecific seed and seedling densities, and mean phylogenetic distance of heterospecific seeds and seedling. Conspecific seed density had a significant negative effect on seedling transition rates for 12 of 13 focal species. In contrast, conspecific seedling density had a positive effect for 7 species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences. Few species were significantly affected by the density or phylogenetic relatedness of heterospecific seeds and seedlings. Only conspecific seed density effects varied among years for most focal species. Overall, our results reveal that conspecific seed and seedling densities play a more important role than the density or relatedness of heterospecific seeds and seedlings during the seed to seedling stage, suggesting that species-specific seed predators, along with habitat preferences, may contribute to diversity maintenance in this forest. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Plant diversity experiments generally find that increased diversity causes increased productivity; however, primary productivity is typically measured in the presence of a diverse food web, including pathogens, mutualists and herbivores. If food web impacts on productivity vary with plant diversity, as predicted by both theoretical and empirical studies, estimates of the effect of plant diversity on productivity may be biased. We experimentally removed arthropods, foliar fungi and soil fungi from the longest-running plant diversity experiment. We found that fungi and arthropods removed a constant, large proportion of biomass leading to a greater reduction of total biomass in high diversity plots. As a result, the effect of diversity on measured plant productivity was much higher in the absence of fungi and arthropods. Thus, diversity increases productivity more than reported in previous studies that did not control for the effects of heterotrophic consumption. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS},

abstract={Plant species generate specific soil communities that feedback on plant growth and competition. These feedbacks have been implicated in plant community composition and dispersion. We used Lactuca sativa and its wild progenitor Lactuca serriola to test the hypotheses that separate Lactuca species generate unique soil communities and that these soil communities differentially influence host, and neighboring, plant growth and competition. We grew each Lactuca in competition with the other, in sterile and non-sterile soils. We then examined the growth of each Lactuca species in sterile, non-sterile, and preconditioned soil. Finally, we used TRFLP techniques to explore whether the two Lactuca species generate significantly different bacterial communities in their rhizosphere soils. L. sativa proved to be the stronger competitor of the two species. However, sterilization increased the competitive effect of L. serriola background competitors. The growth experiment showed a significant effect on plant species, soil treatment, and the interaction of the two. Preconditioning soil caused reduced growth in both Lactuca species. Only L. serriola showed significantly increased growth in sterile soils. Our TRFLP analysis showed that the L. sativa soil community was significantly less diverse and that soil preconditioning had the largest impact on the community composition. These results show that Lactuca serriola’s rhizosphere communities generate a stronger negative feedback for plant growth than do the communities associated with L. sativa. Our study suggests that selection for plants that are able to grow in dense monoculture may have released Lactuca from species-specific negative soil feedbacks. This has important implications for both agriculture and the evolution of invasive plant species. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In South Africa, maize is often produced on highly weathered soils with low organic matter contents. These soils are unable to supply sufficient nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for sustainable maize production, resulting in the use of fertiliser sources containing either N or P. In some instances, however, the efficiency of these sources may be questioned. In a glasshouse pot experiment, young maize aerial plant material was analysed to evaluate the effect of band-applied N sources, P sources and P application rates on the quantitative nutrient concentration, as well as uptake of several nutrients. With the exception of potassium uptake, all parameters were significantly affected by the main effects only. Nutrient concentration measurements were inconsistent for N sources. However, total uptake proved to be more efficient with the application of limestone ammonium nitrate compared with that of urea. Both nutrient concentration and uptake were greater with the application of the orthophosphate sources monoammonium phosphate and nitrophosphate compared with the polyphosphate source ammonium polyphosphate. The 40 kg P ha−1 application enhanced the uptake of N, P, calcium, sulphur and boron. No applications of P lead to increased N, magnesium, copper and zinc concentrations. © 2017 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.},

abstract={Spatially separated aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) herbivores are closely linked through shared host plants, and both patterns of AG-BG interactions and plant responses may vary among plant genotypes. We subjected invasive (USA) and native (China) genotypes of tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) to herbivory by the AG specialist leaf-rolling weevil Heterapoderopsis bicallosicollis and/or the root-feeding larvae of flea beetle Bikasha collaris. We measured leaf damage and leaves rolled by weevils, quantified beetle survival, and analyzed flavonoid and tannin concentrations in leaves and roots. AG and BG herbivores formed negative feedbacks on both native and invasive genotypes. Leaf damage by weevils and the number of beetle larvae emerging as adults were higher on invasive genotypes. Beetles reduced weevil damage and weevils reduced beetle larval emergence more strongly for invasive genotypes. Invasive genotypes had lower leaf and root tannins than native genotypes. BG beetles decreased leaf tannins of native genotypes but increased root tannins of invasive genotypes. AG herbivory increased root flavonoids of invasive genotypes while BG herbivory decreased leaf flavonoids. Invasive genotypes had lower AG and BG herbivore resistance, and negative AG-BG herbivore feedbacks were much stronger for invasive genotypes. Lower tannin concentrations explained overall better AG and BG herbivore performances on invasive genotypes. However, changes in tannins and flavonoids affected AG and BG herbivores differently. These results suggest that divergent selection on chemical production in invasive plants may be critical in regulating herbivore performances and novel AG and BG herbivore communities in new environments. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Over the last two decades, an increasing number of studies have quantified the effects of herbivory on plant populations using stage-structured population models and integral projection models, allowing for the calculation of plant population growth rates (λ) with and without herbivory. In this paper, I assembled 29 studies and conducted a meta-regression to determine the importance of invertebrate herbivores to population growth rates (λ) while accounting for missing data. I found that invertebrate herbivory often induced important reductions in plant population growth rates (with herbivory, λ was 1.08 ± 0.36; without herbivory, λ was 1.28 ± 0.58). This relationship tended to be weaker for seed predation than for other types of herbivory, except when seed predation rates were very high. Even so, the amount by which studies reduced herbivory was a poor predictor of differences in population growth rates—which strongly cautions against using measured herbivory rates as a proxy for the impact of herbivores. Herbivory reduced plant population growth rates significantly more when potential growth rates were high, which helps to explain why there was less variation in actual population growth rates than in potential population growth rates. The synthesis of these studies also shows the need for future studies to report variance in estimates of λ and to quantify how λ varies as a function of plant density. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={An explicit phylogenetic perspective provides useful tools for phytopathology and plant disease ecology because the traits of both plants and microbes are shaped by their evolutionary histories. We present brief primers on phylogenetic signal and the analytical tools of phylogenetic ecology. We review the literature and find abundant evidence of phylogenetic signal in pathogens and plants for most traits involved in disease interactions. Plant nonhost resistance mechanisms and pathogen housekeeping functions are conserved at deeper phylogenetic levels, whereas molecular traits associated with rapid coevolutionary dynamics are more labile at branch tips. Horizontal gene transfer disrupts the phylogenetic signal for some microbial traits. Emergent traits, such as host range and disease severity, show clear phylogenetic signals. Therefore pathogen spread and disease impact are influenced by the phylogenetic structure of host assemblages. Phylogenetically rare species escape disease pressure. Phylogenetic tools could be used to develop predictive tools for phytosanitary risk analysis and reduce disease pressure in multispecies cropping systems. © 2016 by Annual Reviews.

abstract={The plant–soil feedback (PSF) framework has become an important theory in plant ecology, yet many ecological and evolutionary factors that influence PSFs have yet to be fully considered. Here, we discuss the importance of local adaptation among plants and root-associated fungi and bacteria. Furthermore, we show how inclusion of the optimal resource allocation (OA) model can help predict the direction and outcome of PSFs under environmental change. Plants and associated soil microbes have co-evolved for millennia, generating adaptations to each other and to their local environment. This local co-adaptation is likely generated by a suite of multidirectional exchanges of goods and services among plants, fungi and bacteria, and the constant changes in above-ground–below-ground interactions. Resource limitation may be a driver of local adaptation among organisms involved in nutritional symbioses. The OA model states that when an essential resource is limited, natural selection will favour taxa that forage optimally by adjusting their biomass and energy allocation such that productivity is equally limited by all resources. Co-adaptation will therefore respond to the local limiting resource conditions through taxa-specific resource transfer interactions. The OA model can help predict the outcomes of PSFs across a range of resource gradients and environmental changes such as increasing drought or atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Positive feedback is predicted in systems where resource exchange among plants and associated soil microbes can ameliorate resource limitation, or in systems where microbes provide another important service such as pathogen defence. Feedback strength is expected to diminish as resources become less limiting. Negative feedback is predicted when resources are in luxury supply and populations of opportunistic plant pathogens increase relative to commensal or mutualist microbes. Future, field-based studies that integrate naturally co-occurring systems of plants, microbes and their local soil are needed to further test the hypothesis that resource availability is an effective predictor of the direction and magnitude of PSFs. A more mechanistic understanding of PSFs will help land managers and farmers to manipulate plant–microbial soil interactions to respond to environmental change and to effectively harness beneficial symbioses for plant nutrition and pathogen control. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Endogenous jasmonates are important regulators of plant defenses. If and how they enable plants to maintain their reproductive output when facing community-level herbivory under natural conditions, however, remains unknown. We demonstrate that jasmonate-deficient Nicotiana attenuata plants suffer more damage by arthropod and vertebrate herbivores than jasmonate-producing plants in nature. However, only damage by vertebrate herbivores translates into a significant reduction in flower production. Vertebrate stem peeling has the strongest negative impact on plant flower production. Stems are defended by jasmonate-dependent nicotine, and the native cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus nuttallii avoids jasmonate-producing N. attenuata shoots because of their high levels of nicotine. Thus, endogenous jasmonates enable plants to resist different types of herbivores in nature, and jasmonate-dependent defenses are important for plants to maintain their reproductive potential when facing vertebrate herbivory. Ecological and evolutionary models on plant defense signaling should aim at integrating arthropod and vertebrate herbivory at the community level. © Machado et al.},

abstract={Interactions between plants and soil microorganisms influence individual plant performance and thus plant-community composition. Most studies on such plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have been performed under controlled greenhouse conditions, whereas no study has directly compared PSFs under greenhouse and natural field conditions. We grew three grass species that differ in local abundance in grassland communities simultaneously in the greenhouse and field on field-collected soils either previously conditioned by these species or by the general grassland community. As soils in grasslands are typically conditioned by mixes of species through the patchy and heterogeneous plant species’ distributions, we additionally compared the effects of species-specific versus non-specific species conditioning on PSFs in natural and greenhouse conditions. In almost all comparisons PSFs differed between the greenhouse and field. In the greenhouse, plant growth in species-specific and non-specific soils resulted in similar effects with neutral PSFs for the most abundant species and positive PSFs for the less abundant species. In contrast, in the field all grass species tested performed best in non-specific plots, whereas species-specific PSFs were neutral for the most abundant and varied for the less abundant species. This indicates a general beneficial effect of plant diversity on PSFs in the field. Controlled greenhouse conditions might provide valuable insights on the nominal effects of soils on plants. However, the PSFs observed in greenhouse conditions may not be the determining drivers in natural plant communities where their effects may be overwhelmed by the diversity of abiotic and biotic above- and belowground interactions in the field. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Plant patch structure and environmental context can influence the outcome of antagonistic and mutualistic plant–insect interactions, leading to spatially variable fitness effects for plants. We investigated the effects of herbivory and pollen limitation on plant reproductive performance in 28 patches of the self-compatible perennial herb Scrophularia nodosa and assessed how such effects varied with plant patch size, plant density and tree cover. Both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions had strong effects on plant reproductive performance. Leaf feeding from herbivores reduced both fruit production and seed germination, and leaf herbivory increased with plant patch size. Experimentally hand-pollinated flowers produced more seeds than open-pollinated flowers, and pollen limitation was more severe in patches with fewer plants. Our study on S. nodosa is one of few which documents that plant patch structure influences the outcome of both antagonistic and mutualistic plant–insect interactions. The results thus provide an example of how variation in plant patch structure and environmental factors can lead to spatially variable fitness effects from mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Plant-plant and plant-soil interactions can help maintain plant diversity and ecosystem functions. Changes in these interactions may underlie experimentally observed increases in biodiversity effects over time via the selection of genotypes adapted to low or high plant diversity. Little is known, however, about such community-history effects and particularly the role of plant-soil interactions in this process. Soil-legacy effects may occur if co-evolved interactions with soil communities either positively or negatively modify plant biodiversity effects. We tested how plant selection and soil legacy influence biodiversity effects on productivity, and whether such effects increase the resistance of the communities to invasion by weeds. We used two plant selection treatments: parental plants growing in monoculture or in mixture over 8 yr in a grassland biodiversity experiment in the field, which we term monoculture types and mixture types. The two soil-legacy treatments used in this study were neutral soil inoculated with live or sterilized soil inocula collected from the same plots in the biodiversity experiment. For each of the four factorial combinations, seedlings of eight species were grown in monocultures or four-species mixtures in pots in an experimental garden over 15 weeks. Soil legacy (live inoculum) strongly increased biodiversity complementarity effects for communities of mixture types, and to a significantly weaker extent for communities of monoculture types. This may be attributed to negative plant-soil feedbacks suffered by mixture types in monocultures, whereas monoculture types had positive plant-soil feedbacks, in both monocultures and mixtures. Monocultures of mixture types were most strongly invaded by weeds, presumably due to increased pathogen susceptibility, reduced biomass, and altered plant-soil interactions of mixture types. These results show that biodiversity effects in experimental grassland communities can be modified by the evolution of positive vs. negative plant-soil feedbacks of plant monoculture vs. mixture types. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Loss in seed yield and therefore decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores is not necessarily additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, it is not clear how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and stem weevils, pollen beetles, and pod midges. Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and stem weevils was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Many plants produce defense chemicals that are induced in response to damage. In spite of the tight links between floral tissue and plant reproduction, very little is known about whether floral defenses are induced in response to floral damage. We manipulated Impatiens capensis flowers to determine whether floral damage reduces subsequent florivory, whether it induces anthocyanins or condensed tannins in floral tissues, and whether responses are localized or systemic. We damaged one flower per plant at one of three damage levels (0, 30, or 60 % tissue removal), collected subsequent flowers at set time intervals and branch locations, and measured whole-plant florivory for 3 weeks following damage. We also observed a flower color polymorphism and analyzed responses separately for red- and yellow-flowered plants. Moderate damage to a single flower reduced subsequent whole-plant florivory, but heavy damage did not. Moderate damage to a focal flower also increased anthocyanins in subsequent flowers on the same branch of red-flowered plants, but decreased anthocyanins on parallel-branch flowers of yellow-flowered plants. Damage did not affect floral tannins. Because the reduction in florivory was systemic and induced anthocyanins were not consistently induced systemically, there may be other secondary compounds not measured in this study that were systemically induced, or effects of visual or olfactory cues of damage itself that reduced subsequent florivory. This is the first study demonstrating that damage to a single flower can reduce subsequent whole-plant florivory in the field, indicating that initial damage can have cascading effects on subsequent interactions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Herbivory can negatively affect several components of plant reproduction. Yet, because of a lack of experimental studies involving multiple populations, the extent to which differences in herbivory contribute to among-population variation in plant reproductive success is poorly known. We experimentally determined the effects of insect herbivory on reproductive output in nine natural populations of the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria along a disturbance gradient in an archipelago in northern Sweden, and we quantified among-population differentiation in resistance to herbivory in a common-garden experiment in the same area. The intensity of leaf herbivory varied >500-fold and mean female reproductive success >400-fold among the study populations. The intensity of herbivory was lowest in populations subject to strong disturbance from ice and wave action. Experimental removal of insect herbivores showed that the effect of herbivory on female reproductive success was correlated with the intensity of herbivory and that differences in insect herbivory could explain much of the among-population variation in the proportion of plants flowering and seed production. Population differentiation in resistance to herbivory was limited. The results demonstrate that the intensity of herbivory is a major determinant of flowering and seed output in L. salicaria, but that differences in herbivory are not associated with differences in plant resistance at the spatial scale examined. They further suggest that the physical disturbance regime may strongly influence the performance and abundance of perennial herbs and patterns of selection not only because of its effect on interspecific competition, but also because of effects on interactions with specialized herbivores. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Plants produce large amounts of secondary metabolites in their shoots and roots and store them in specialized secretory structures. Although secondary metabolites and their secretory structures are commonly assumed to have a defensive function, evidence that they benefit plant fitness under herbivore attack is scarce, especially below ground. Here, we tested whether latex secondary metabolites produced by the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale agg.) decrease the performance of its major native insect root herbivore, the larvae of the common cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha), and benefit plant vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack. Across 17 T. officinale genotypes screened by gas and liquid chromatography, latex concentrations of the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G) were negatively associated with M. melolontha larval growth. Adding purified TA-G to artificial diet at ecologically relevant concentrations reduced larval feeding. Silencing the germacrene A synthase ToGAS1, an enzyme that was identified to catalyze the first committed step of TA-G biosynthesis, resulted in a 90% reduction of TA-G levels and a pronounced increase in M. melolontha feeding. Transgenic, TA-G-deficient lines were preferred by M. melolontha and suffered three times more root biomass reduction than control lines. In a common garden experiment involving over 2,000 T. officinale individuals belonging to 17 different genotypes, high TA-G concentrations were associated with the maintenance of high vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack. Taken together, our study demonstrates that a latex secondary metabolite benefits plants under herbivore attack, a result that provides a mechanistic framework for root herbivore driven natural selection and evolution of plant defenses below ground. © 2016 Huber et al.},

abstract={Non-native invasive plants can associate with and accumulate microbes in their introduced range, which may transfer to native plants and potentially exert pathogenic effects. In these cases, the invasive plant can act as a pathogen reservoir. However, little is known about this as a possible plant invasion mechanism. We isolated fungi from the roots of 32 Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) plants collected across Ontario, Canada, where it is highly invasive. The growth effects of known pathogenic fungi were tested on V. rossicum and two commonly co-occurring native plants, Asclepias syriaca (Apocynaceae) and Solidago canadensis (Asteraceae). We hypothesised that these fungi would reduce the growth of native plants more than that of V. rossicum. Of the18 fungal taxa isolated from V. rossicum roots, 15 were previously reported as pathogens on other plants and 16 represent new records on this plant. Four of the seven fungi tested on V. rossicum increased its total biomass and/or root-shoot ratio compared to uninoculated controls. When inoculated individually, three of these fungi had neutral growth effects on the native plants. However, when inoculated together, Cadophora sp., Ilyonectria radicicola, and Macrophomina phaseolina reduced the total biomass of S. canadensis. These results support that at least in some cases non-native invaders may benefit from associating with soil microbes that can function as pathogens on native plants. These differential functional outcomes between non-native invasive and native plants may be important for mediating plant community structure and the persistence of invasive plants. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Revegetation of the tailings dumps produced by various industrial activities is necessary to prevent dust storms and erosion and represents a great challenge for ecological restoration. Little is known about the microbial colonisation and community structure of revegetated tailings following site exploitation. Here, we report the sequencing of 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fungal RNA gene amplicons from chlor-alkali residue and from an adjacent undisturbed soil to define the composition and assembly of the rhizosphere microbial communities. After quality filtering, a total of 72,373 and 89,929 bacterial sequences and 122,618 and 111,209 fungal sequences remained for community analysis from undisturbed soil and tailings dump samples, respectively. These reads were affiliated with 45 bacterial and 9 fungal phyla and 113 bacterial and 35 fungal classes. We observed a clear dominance of Gammaproteobacteria at our study site (24% of total sequences), especially of the Pseudomonas genera (72% of Gammaproteobacteria sequences), together with the dominance of a few fungal taxa, such as Hebeloma and Geopora. However, we also noticed that the core microbiome comprised 64.4% and 62.4% of the bacterial and fungal genera, respectively, despite marked differences in soil physico-chemical properties. A heatmap of correlations between soil parameters and taxa confirmed that approximately 50% of the 33 dominant taxa colonised both types of soil. We further demonstrated that the global bacterial-fungal network topology of the dump approximated that of the undisturbed soil. Our approach illuminates the importance of studying more than just a single component of the microbial community and represents a step forward in uncovering the microbial ecology of disturbed environments beyond what is generally found in conventional studies. Our study also provides novel global community proxies that have led us to conclude that environmental filtering is more likely to occur through the activity of tree roots rather than as a result of specific soil characteristics and could be an important force in the assembly of at least some microbial communities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The impact of mutualists on a partner’s demography depends on how they affect the partner’s multiple vital rates and how those vital rates, in turn, affect population growth. However, mutualism studies rarely measure effects on multiple vital rates or integrate them to assess the ultimate impact on population growth. We used vital rate data, population models and simulations of long-term population dynamics to quantify the demographic impact of a guild of ant species on the plant Ferocactus wislizeni. The ants feed at the plant’s extrafloral nectaries and attack herbivores attempting to consume reproductive organs. Ant-guarded plants produced significantly more fruit, but ants had no significant effect on individual growth or survival. After integrating ant effects across these vital rates, we found that projected population growth was not significantly different between unguarded and ant-guarded plants because population growth was only weakly influenced by differences in fruit production (though strongly influenced by differences in individual growth and survival). However, simulations showed that ants could positively affect long-term plant population dynamics through services provided during rare but important events (herbivore outbreaks that reduce survival or years of high seedling recruitment associated with abundant precipitation). Thus, in this seemingly clear example of mutualism, the interaction may actually yield no clear benefit to plant population growth, or if it does, may only do so through the actions of the ants during rare events. These insights demonstrate the value of taking a demographic approach to studying the consequences of mutualism. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract={Key message: This study showed the negative effects of insect defoliation on the reproduction of canopy trees, where defoliation was not artificially manipulated but rather observed in a natural setting. Abstract: The gypsy moth (Lymantria diapar) is a serious defoliator with the ability to completely defoliate forest canopies. Although the negative effects of defoliation on tree reproduction have been revealed in studies with artificially manipulated defoliation, few studies have examined the effect of insect defoliation on the reproduction of canopy trees under natural condition. In this study, visual surveys were used to clarify the effect of gypsy moth defoliation on the production of acorns by oaks (Quercus spp.). Surveys were conducted in an outbreak year at 22 sites in central Japan (13 sites with Quercus crispula and nine sites with Q. serrata). Five of the Q. crispula sites were severely defoliated (mean defoliation ranged from 67 to 88 %), while the remainder of the Q. crispula sites and all of the Q. serrata sites were lightly defoliated (0–20 %). A negative effect of gypsy moth defoliation on acorn production was detected for Q. crispula. However, there was a synchronous decrease in acorn production from the previous year and crop levels were low at all sites regardless of the defoliation severity. The consistent low crop levels were likely the result of weather-related factors. Defoliation also negatively affected the production of acorns for Q. serrata; however, severe defoliation was not present at any Q. serrata sites. This study suggests that insect defoliation can affect forest ecosystem processes, such as the regeneration of host trees and the behavior of wildlife that depend on seed production, by reducing the reproductive potential of host trees. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Most flowering plants are hermaphrodites. However, in gynodioecious species, some members of the population are male-sterile and reproduce only by setting seed, while others gain fitness through both male and female function. How females compensate for the loss of male function remains unresolved for most gynodioecious species. Here, as with many plants, fitness differences may be influenced by interactions with multiple species. However, whether multiple species interactions result in gender-specific fitness differences remains unknown. Using observational data from 2009-2010, we quantified seed set of the two sex morphs of Polemonium foliosissimum and asked how it is affected by pollination, and seed predation from a dipteran predispersal seed predator (Anthomyiidae: Hylemya sp.). We assessed seed production and losses to predation in 27 populations for one year and in six populations for a second year. Females set significantly more seed than did hermaphrodites in both years. Of the fitness components we assessed, including the number of flowers per plant, fruit set, seeds/fruit, and proportion of fruits destroyed by Hylemya, only fruit destruction differed significantly between the sexes. In one year, seeds/fruit and predation had a stronger effect on seed set for hermaphrodites than for females. Because predispersal seed predators do not pollinate flowers, their effects may depend on successful pollination of flowers on which they oviposit. To examine if genders differed in pollen limitation and seed predation and/or their interactive effects, in 2011 we hand-pollinated flowers and removed seed predator eggs in a fully factorial design. Both sexes were pollen limited, but their degree of pollen limitation did not differ. However, predation reduced seed set more for hermaphrodites than for females. We found no significant interaction between hand pollen and seed predation, and no interaction between hand pollination and gender. Our results suggest that while interactions with both pollinators and seed predators affect reproductive success, floral enemies can cause inequality in seed set between genders. The next step is to understand how the seed set advantage affects long-term fitness and persistence of females in gynodioecious populations. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Since its introduction from Europe, balsam woolly adelgid [. Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae)], a phloem-sap feeder, has spread throughout the balsam fir [. Abies balsamea L. (Mill.)] forests of eastern Canada. Trees under A. piceae attack develop "gout" and differ from unattacked trees in physiology, morphology, growth, and chemistry. The native and eruptive eastern spruce budworm [. Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)] also attacks fir, causing severe defoliation during outbreaks. While balsam woolly adelgid and budworm feed at different times and on different host tissues, such spatiotemporally separated herbivores may still interact via host-mediated indirect effects. We examined the relationship between gout and the performance of developing budworm larvae in balsam fir dominated stands in western Newfoundland. We tested for adelgid-budworm interactions in unthinned and precommercially-thinned (~20. years past) stands, because the host's growing condition can affect foliage composition and herbivore performance.Budworm attained lower pupal weight when reared on trees with high levels of gout. In unthinned stands moderate gout reduced budworm survivorship, but there was no such effect in thinned stands. Gout did not affect budworm sex ratio. Although our data are consistent with interactions mediated by foliage quality (rather than quantity), and although budworm survivorship was associated with several aspects of foliage chemistry (Mg and N, positive; monoterpenes, negative), we were unable to identify specific host quality changes underlying the adelgid-budworm interaction. Our study demonstrates that A. piceae attack is an important factor influencing budworm performance, and it should be considered when analyzing budworm population dynamics and when developing management protocols for forests impacted by A. piceae attack. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aims: Our aim was to explore the way that root system type affects mycorrhizal growth response of plants.
Methods: An extensive meta-analysis with 943 peer-review publications was conducted to test the difference in mycorrhizal responses between taproot plants and plants with a fibrous root system.
Results: We found that taproot plants showed greater growth response (biomass, P and N uptake) to colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) than do plant species with fibrous root systems. This response pattern was dependent on stress types, AMF identity and species richness, and particularly the type of stress (abiotic vs. biotic). Taproot plants respond more to AMF than plants with a fibrous root system; but no difference was shown under biotic stress. The interaction effect seen for AMF and biotic stress was significantly higher for plants with fibrous root system, but was not significant between taproot plants and abiotic stress. Difference in biomass response was only found for Glomeraceae and Gigasporaceae between the two types of plants, while difference was found in P uptake response for Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae. However, plants with fibrous root system showed higher growth response than taproot plants under nematode stress.
Conclusions: Taproot plants might be more dependent on mycorrhiza than plants with fibrous root system. This indicates that environmental conditions can modify the relative abundance of taproot plants and plants with fibrous root system through mycorrhizal functioning, which will regulate plant community dynamics and processes. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Recently, a theoretical hypothesis was proposed that the coexistence of antagonism and mutualism may stabilize ecological community and even give rise to a positive complexity-stability relationship (interaction-type diversity hypothesis). This hypothesis was derived from an analysis of community model, which was developed based on two specific assumptions about the interaction strengths: those are, (i) different interaction types, antagonism and mutualism, have quantitatively comparable magnitude of effects to population growth; and (ii) interaction strength decreases with increasing interaction links of the same interaction type. However, those assumptions do not necessarily hold in real ecosystems, leaving unclear how robust this hypothesis is. Here, using a model with those two assumptions relaxed, we show (i) that the balance of interaction strength is necessary for the positive complexity effect to arise and (ii) that interaction-type diversity hypothesis may still hold when interaction strength decreases with increasing links of all interaction type for some species. © 2015, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.},

abstract={Mutualists and antagonists are known to respond to similar floral cues, and may thus cause opposing selection on floral traits. However, we lack a quantitative understanding of their independent and interactive effects. In a population of the orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, we manipulated the intensity of pollination and herbivory in a factorial design to examine whether both interactions influence selection on flowering phenology, floral display, and morphology. Supplemental hand-pollination increased female fitness by 31% and one-quarter of all plants were damaged by herbivores. Both interactions contributed to selection. Pollinators mediated selection for later flowering and herbivores for earlier flowering, while both selected for longer spurs. The strength of selection was similar for both agents, and their effects were additive. As a consequence, there was no net selection on phenology, whereas selection on spur length was strong. The experimental results demonstrate that both pollinators and herbivores can markedly influence the strength of selection on flowering phenology and floral morphology, and cause both conflicting and reinforcing selection. They also indicate that the direction of selection on phenology will vary with the relative intensity of the mutualistic and antagonistic interaction, potentially resulting in both temporal and among-population variation in optimal flowering time. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Aim: High species richness at small spatial scales can increase productivity and resist exotic invasion through complementary and selection effects. Recent evidence also suggests that soil biota can drive the increase in productivity caused by high species richness. Here, we take this a step farther and investigate whether soil biota can also affect how high species richness resists invasion. Location: Missoula, Montana, USA. Methods: Ten native grassland species were used to create plant assemblages with either one species (monocultures) or 10 species (polycultures) in a common garden. Soils cultured by these assemblages were collected and either sterilized or not to examine the combined effects of species richness and soil biota on the growth and competitive ability of the 10 native species against the invader Bromus tectorum. Results: Live soil from monocultures inhibited the growth of all native species as a group and native grasses as a functional group more than live soil from polycultures. Sterilization eliminated the negative effects of soil from monocultures but not from polycultures. Native species also competed with B. tectorum more successfully in live soil from polycultures than live soil from monocultures, and sterilization eliminated the competitive advantage of natives in live polyculture soil. Main conclusions: We found that local plant species richness can affect soil biota in ways that can increase the competitive effects of natives against an aggressive exotic invader; thus, our results suggest a mechanism by which species diversity might provide resistance to exotic invasion. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Nutrient limitation is a basic ecological constraint that has received little attention in studies on virus production and disease dynamics. Nutrient availability could directly limit the production of viral nucleic acids and proteins, or alternatively limit host growth and thus indirectly limit metabolic pathways necessary for viral replication. In order to compare direct and indirect effects of nutrient limitation on virus production within hosts, we manipulated soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability in a glasshouse for the wild grass host Bromus hordeaceus and the viral pathogen Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV. We found that soil N additions increased viral concentrations within host tissues, and the effect was mediated by host growth. Specifically, in statistical models evaluating the roles of host biomass production, leaf N and leaf P, viral production depended most strongly on host biomass, rather than the concentration of either nutrient. Furthermore, at low soil N, larger plants supported greater viral concentrations than smaller ones, whereas at high N, smaller plants supported greater viral concentrations. Our results suggest that enhanced viral productivity under N enrichment is an indirect consequence of nutrient stimulation to host growth rate. Heightened pathogen production in plants has important implications for a world facing increasing rates of nutrient deposition. © 2015 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={1. Oviposition choices can profoundly affect offspring performance. Oviposition decisions of the dipteran pre-dispersal seed predator, Hylemya sp. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), when choosing among sex morphs of their host-plant-Polemonium foliosissimum Hook-were evaluated. Polemonium foliosissimum is gynodioecious, with female and hermaphrodite sex morphs that differ in flower size. 2. It was asked: Do female flies preferentially oviposit on hermaphrodite plants and, if so, are oviposition choices correlated with flower size? Is larval survivorship higher on hermaphrodite plants and, if so, is larval success correlated with flower size? Can the differences in oviposition and/or larval success be explained by slight differences in flowering phenology between the sexes? 3. Hermaphrodite flowers received 45% more Hylemya eggs than females. Although hermaphrodites had larger petals and sepals than females, egg loads were not correlated with petal or sepal size. Larval survival was 30% greater on hermaphrodites than females and higher on plants with larger sepals. However, the difference in sepal area between genders did not fully explain larval survival differences. Egg numbers declined over weeks, but differences in egg loads between the sex morphs were not attributable to a slight phenological delay of females. Larval survival declined over the season; however, larval survival differences between sex morphs were consistent. 4. Hylemya preferentially oviposited on hermaphrodites where their larvae had a significantly greater survival rate compared with females. The present results add to the knowledge that intra-specific choices have consequences for phytophagous insects and that the relationship between antagonists and their gynodioecious host plants is complex. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={Interactions between plant and soil communities are known to play an integral role in shaping ecosystems. Plants influence the composition of soil communities and soil communities in turn influence plant performance. Such a plant-soil feedback may incur selection pressure on plants and the associating soil community. However, the evolutionary consequences of these above-belowground feedback interactions remain largely speculative. Here we assess whether plant-soil feedback effects differ between intraspecific plant populations and between generations within the same plant population. We used two populations of Trifolium pratense and assessed their performance when grown in association with their home versus away soil biota. Both populations were colonized by distinct microbial communities and performed better with their own home soil communities than with the soil community from the other intraspecific population, demonstrating intraspecific positive feedback effects of home soil. In one of the two populations, we found that plant performance and the root associated microbiota community differed between parental and progeny plants when inoculated with their own home soil. Differences in root associated community characteristics could explain more than 80% of the variation in performance among the progeny and parental plants. Our results highlight that intraspecific differences in both plant and associated soil communities shape plant-soil feedback effects, and consequently indicate that plant-soil feedback can influence the direction of selection between intraspecific plant populations. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Pathogens can accumulate on invasive plants over time, which could lead to population declines. The time required for these dynamics to occur is unknown and seldom addressed. Furthermore, no study has assessed plant-soil feedback while characterizing plant pathogen and mutualist root fungal communities in the context of invasion time. We used a plant-soil feedback study and 454 pyrosequencing to investigate pathogen accumulation over 100years on a highly invasive plant in eastern North America that shows localized declines, Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae). We collected soil from five sites representing each of four invasion periods of V.rossicum across Ontario, Canada (old, c.100years; intermediate, 50-60years; young, < 12years; and uninvaded), and grew V.rossicum in these soils in a glasshouse study. Our hypothesis was that plants grown in soils invaded for longer periods of time would experience less positive feedbacks compared to those grown in more recently invaded or uninvaded soils. We collected roots of V.rossicum from the invasion periods and performed 454 pyrosequencing targeting fungi. We hypothesized that the abundance and richness of fungi that are known plant pathogens would be higher in roots from older invasions compared to more recent invasions. Contrasting with our hypothesis, V.rossicum experienced overall growth promotion due to soil biota, regardless of invasion period. Vincetoxicum rossicum roots were colonized by a large number of fungal taxa, including many known plant pathogens or mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, we found no evidence of pathogen accumulation in older invaded sites in terms of species composition, richness or abundance. Synthesis. Our consistent results in the glasshouse and the field highlight the strength of combining high-throughput sequencing data with plant-soil feedback experiments. We showed that the roots of Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) were colonized by many fungal taxa, but found no evidence for changes in plant growth or accumulation of fungal pathogens with longer invasion time. High pathogen loads may not lead to concurrent declines in invasive plants. Plant invasions, as demonstrated by V.rossicum, may be unpredictable in their ability to accumulate pathogens capable of leading to population declines. We showed that the roots of the non-native invasive plant Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) were colonised by many fungal taxa, but found no evidence for changes in plant growth or accumulation of fungal pathogens with longer invasion time. High pathogen loads may not lead to concurrent declines in invasive plants. Plant invasions, as demonstrated by V.rossicum, may be unpredictable in their ability to accumulate pathogens capable of leading to population declines. © 2015 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Soil fauna is essential for ecosystem dynamics as it is involved in biogeochemical processes, promotes nutrient availability, and affects the animal communities associated with plants. In this study, we examine the possible relationship between the soil micro-arthropod community on foliage production and quality of the shrub Pittocaulon praecox. We also examine the arthropods associated to its foliage, particularly the size of the main herbivores and of their natural enemies, at two sites with contrasting vegetation cover and productivity. The diversity of soil microarthropods was assessed from soil samples collected monthly under P. praecox individuals over 13 mo. Specimens collected were identified to species or morphospecies. Shrub foliage productivity was evaluated through the amount of litter produced. Resource quality was assessed by the mean content (percentage by weight) of N, C, S, and P of 30 leaves from each shrub. The mean size of herbivores and their natural enemies were determined by measuring 20 adult specimens of each of the most abundant species. We found a higher species richness of soil microarthropods and foliar arthropods in the open site, although the diversity of foliage arthropods was lower in the closed site. Shrubs growing in the closed site tend to produce more, larger, and nutritionally poorer (lower nitrogen content) leaves than open site. Herbivores and their natural enemies were also larger in the closed site. We found a significant positive relationship between the diversity and species richness of foliar arthropods and the nitrogen content of leaves. In general, species richness and diversity of both the foliar and soil fauna, as well as the size of organisms belonging to higher trophic levels, were affected by vegetation cover and primary productivity at each site. These findings highlight the need to simultaneously consider at least four trophic levels (soil organisms, plants, herbivores, and natural enemies) to better understand the functioning of these systems and their responses to environmental changes. © The Author 2015.},

abstract={Inoculation may influence mycorrhizal colonization and provide benefits to plants in restoration projects. However, it is unclear whether inoculation has consistent effects across ecosystem types, if it has long-term effects on colonization, and whether sources of inocula differ in their effectiveness. To address these issues, we performed a meta-analysis of published restoration studies across a variety of ecosystems to examine the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on mycorrhizal establishment and plant growth under field conditions. Although we included trials from a variety of geographic locations, disturbance types, and ecosystem types, the majority were based in temperate ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere, and fewer trials were from tropical ecosystems. Across ecosystem types, we found that inoculation consistently increased the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in degraded ecosystems, and thus improved the establishment of plants. These benefits did not significantly attenuate over time. Moreover, inocula from different sources varied in their effects on mycorrhizal colonization. Inocula sourced from reference ecosystems and inocula with specific fungal species yielded higher increases in mycorrhizal colonization than did inocula from commercial sources. These results suggest that inocula source matters, and that an initial investment into mycorrhizal inoculation could provide lasting benefits for facilitating the establishment of the below- and aboveground components of restored ecosystems. © 2015 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Damage by small herbivores can have disproportionately large effects on the fitness of individual plants if damage is concentrated on valuable tissues or on select individuals within a population. In marine systems, the impact of tissue loss on the growth rates of habitat-forming algae is poorly understood. We quantified the grazing damage by an isopod Amphoroidea typa on two species of large kelps, Lessonia spicata and Macrocystis pyrifera, in temperate Chile to test whether non-lethal grazing damage could reduce kelp growth rates and photosynthetic efficiency. For L. spicata, grazing damage was widespread in the field, unevenly distributed on several spatial scales (among individuals and among tissue types) and negatively correlated with blade growth rates. In field experiments, feeding by A. typa reduced the concentration of photosynthetic pigments and led to large reductions (~80 %) in blade growth rates despite limited loss of kelp biomass (0.5 % per day). For M. pyrifera, rates of damage in the field were lower and high densities of grazers were unable to reduce growth rates in field experiments. These results demonstrate that even low per capita grazing rates can result in large reductions in the growth of a kelp, due the spatial clustering of herbivores in the field and the selective removal of photosynthetically active tissues. The impacts of small herbivores on plant performance are thus not easily predicted from consumption rates or abundance in the field, and vary with plant species due to variation in their ability to compensate for damage. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Numerous observational studies have documented conspecific negative density-dependence that is consistent with the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis (JCH) of diversity maintenance. However, there have been few experimental tests of a central prediction of the JCH: that removing host-specific enemies should lead to greater increases in per capita recruitment in areas of higher host density or lower relative phylogenetic diversity. Using spatially randomized plots of high and low host biomass in a temperate grassland biodiversity experiment, we treated developing seedheads of six prairie perennials to factorial applications of fungicide and insecticide. We measured predispersal seed production, seed viability, and seedling biomass. Results were highly species-specific and idiosyncratic. Effects of insect seed predators and fungal pathogens on predispersal responses varied with neither conspecific biomass nor phylogenetic diversity, suggesting that-at least at the predispersal stage and for the insect and fungal seed predators we were able to exclude-the JCH is not sufficient to contribute to negative conspecific density-dependence for these dominant prairie species. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Herbivore damage often deters pollinator visitation and many invasive plants in North America are pollinator-dependent. This has important implications for the biological control of invasive plants because it means that agents that deter pollinators may have a larger than expected impact on the plant. Yet interactions between pollinators and biocontrol agents are rarely evaluated. Centaurea solstitialis, one of the most problematic invasive species in California, is dependent on pollinators for reproduction. I factorially manipulated infection by a biocontrol pathogen and pollen supplementation to test for (1) pollen limitation in C. solstitialis, (2) whether infection increased pollen limitation, and (3) whether this varied across a soil moisture gradient. Plants growing on north-facing slopes where soil moisture was higher experienced mild pollen limitation in the absence of the pathogen and more pronounced pollen limitation when they were infected. Plants on drier south-facing slopes did not suffer from pollen limitation but instead appeared to suffer from resource limitation. Pathogen infection directly reduced seed set in C. solstitialis by 67-72 %. On north-facing slopes, infection had an additional, indirect effect by increasing the degree of pollen limitation plants experienced. The trait that mediates this indirect pathogen-pollinator interaction is the number of inflorescences plants produced: infected plants made fewer inflorescences which led to greater pollen limitation. Although in the present study this outcome is dependent on abiotic factors that vary over small spatial scales, exploiting other invasive plants' dependence on pollinators by selecting agents that deter visitation may enhance agent impact. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract={The net effects of interspecific species interactions on individuals and populations vary in both sign (-, 0, +) and magnitude (strong to weak). Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature. © 2014.},

abstract={Plants are often attacked by pathogens and insects. Their combined impact on plant performance and fitness depends on complicated three-way interactions and the plant's ability to compensate for resource losses. Here, we evaluate the response of Barbarea vulgaris, a wild crucifer, to combined attack by an oomycete Albugo sp., a plant pathogen causing white rust, and a flea beetle, Phyllotreta nemorum. Plants from two B. vulgaris types that differ in resistance to P. nemorum were exposed to Albugo and P. nemorum alone and in combination and then monitored for pathogen infection, herbivore damage, defence compounds, nutritional quality, biomass and seed production. Albugo developed infections in the insect-resistant plants, whereas insect-susceptible plants were scarcely infected. Concentrations of Albugo DNA were higher in plants also exposed to herbivory; similarly, flea beetle larvae caused more damage on Albugo-infected plants. Concentrations of saponins and glucosinolates strongly increased when the plants were exposed to P. nemorum and when the insect-susceptible plants were exposed to Albugo, and some of these compounds increased even more in the combined treatment. The biomass of young insect-susceptible plants was lower following exposure to flea beetles, and the number of leaves of both plant types was negatively affected by combined exposure. After flowering, however, adult plants produced similar numbers of viable seeds, irrespective of treatment. Our findings support the concept that pathogens and herbivores can affect each other's performance on a host plant and that the plant reacts by inducing specific and general defences. However, plants may be able to compensate for biomass loss from single and combined attacks over time. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Coral guard-crabs in the genus Trapezia are well-documented defenders of their pocilloporid coral hosts against coral predators such as the Crown-of-Thorns seastar (Acanthaster planci complex). The objectives of this study were to examine the protective services of six species of Trapezia against corallivory, and the extent of functional diversity among these Trapezia species. Studies conducted in Mo'orea, French Polynesia showed the Trapezia-coral mutualism protected the host corals from multiple predators through functional diversity in the assemblage of crab symbionts. Species differed in their defensive efficacy, but species within similar size classes shared similar abilities. Smallersize Trapezia species, which were previously thought to be ineffective guards, play important defensive roles against small corallivores. We also measured the benefits of this mutualism to corals in the midst of an Acanthaster outbreak that reduced the live coral cover on the fore reef to less than 4%. The mutualism may positively affect the reef coral demography and potential for recovery during adverse predation events through shelter of multiple species ofsmall corals near the host coral.

abstract={Herbivory and pollination are important determinants of female reproductive success in flowering plants. Plants must interact with herbivores and flower visitors simultaneously and interaction with one may alter the outcome of the interaction with the other. These indirect effects can have dramatic impacts on plant fitness. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the stem-boring weevil Mecinus janthiniformis (Curculionidae: Coleoptera) affects flower visitation rate and seed set of the exotic plant Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica (L.) Mill. Scrophulariaceae). We compared the flower production, flower morphology, visitation rate, fruit production, and pollen limitation on Dalmatian toadflax plants with and without larval feeding by M. janthiniformis. Feeding by M. janthiniformis reduced the number of flowers and per plant visitation rate, and there was a significant interaction between herbivory and flower number suggesting that the change in visitation rate was not solely a function of a reduction in flower abundance. Herbivory also had direct negative impacts on the reproductive success of Dalmatian toadflax. Total flower and fruit production decreased by over 30 % in plants attacked by M. janthiniformis. However, plants with M. janthiniformis were not more pollen-limited than those without M. janthiniformis. This suggests that herbivory had primarily direct effects female reproductive success. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Salt stress limits crop yield and sustainable agriculture in most arid and semiarid regions of the world. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. In evaluating AMF as significant predictors of mycorrhizal ecology, precise quantifiable changes in plant biomass and nutrient uptake under salt stress are crucial factors. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to analyze the magnitude of the effects of AMF inoculation on growth and nutrient uptake of plants under salt stress through meta-analyses. For this, data were compared in the context of mycorrhizal host plant species, plant family and functional group, herbaceous vs. woody plants, annual vs. perennial plants, and the level of salinity across 43 studies. Results indicate that, under saline conditions, AMF inoculation significantly increased total, shoot, and root biomass as well as phosphorous (P), nitrogen (N), and potassium (K) uptake. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase also increased significantly in mycorrhizal compared to nonmycorrhizal plants growing under salt stress. In addition, sodium (Na) uptake decreased significantly in mycorrhizal plants, while changes in proline accumulation were not significant. Across most subsets of the data analysis, identities of AMF (Glomus fasciculatum) and host plants (Acacia nilotica, herbs, woody and perennial) were found to be essential in understanding plant responses to salinity stress. For the analyzed dataset, it is concluded that under salt stress, mycorrhizal plants have extensive root traits and mycorrhizal morphological traits which help the uptake of more P and K, together with the enhanced production of antioxidant enzymes resulting in salt stress alleviation and increased plant biomass. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Traditional explorations of interspecific interactions have generated extensive bodies of theory on mutualism and disease independently, but few studies have considered the interaction between them. We developed a model exploring the interactions among a fungal mutualist, a viral pathogen, and their shared plant host. Both microbes were assumed to alter the uptake and use of nutrients by the plant. We found that the productivity of the system and the strength of the plant–fungal mutualism influenced community dynamics. In particular, at low productivity, the pathogen may depend on the presence of the fungal mutualist for persistence. Furthermore, under some conditions, both the productivity of the system and the strength of the plant–fungal mutualism may simultaneously cause the mutualist to go extinct. We note the presence of cyclic plant–pathogen population dynamics only in the presence of the mutualist. As found in other models of consumer–resource interactions, cyclic dynamics were driven by high productivity, but, in contrast to simpler systems, high pathogen effectiveness did not consistently lead to cyclic dynamics.

abstract={Bacteria in the genus Streptomyces are ubiquitous in soil and are well-known for their production of diverse secondary metabolites, including antibiotics that can inhibit soil-borne plant pathogens and suppress disease. Pathogen-suppressive soil bacteria have the potential to influence plant community composition and diversity, but remain relatively unexplored in tropical forest soils. To estimate the potential for disease suppression among Streptomyces communities in tropical dry forests, we cultured soil-borne Streptomyces from plots in two forests in northwestern Costa Rica (Santa Rosa and Palo Verde) and quantified antibiotic-mediated pathogen inhibition against three plant pathogens. The potential for pathogen inhibition and disease suppression by Streptomyces was highly variable across the landscape. Densities of pathogen-suppressive Streptomyces varied by over ten-fold and were correlated with soil nutrients across the plots. In particular, Streptomyces communities became more pathogen-suppressive as labile soil P decreased. Inhibitor densities were significantly higher in Santa Rosa than Palo Verde, which may be related to differences in soil texture and/or plant community composition between the two forests. Our findings suggest potential differences in the degree and specificity of antibiotic-mediated disease suppression in tropical dry forest soils of Costa Rica, and highlight the need for further studies on the drivers of pathogen-suppressive phenotypes as well as the consequences of spatially variable pathogen inhibition for plant community composition in tropical forest ecosystems. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Strong competition from invasive plant species often leads to declines in abundances and may, in certain cases, cause localized extinctions of native plant species. Nevertheless, studies have shown that certain populations of native plant species can co-exist with invasive plant species, suggesting the possibility of adaptive evolutionary responses of those populations to the invasive plants. Empirical inference of evolutionary responses of the native plant species to invasive plants has involved experiments comparing two conspecific groups of native plants for differences in expression of growth/reproductive traits: populations that have experienced competition from the invasive plant species (i.e. experienced natives) versus populations with no known history of interactions with the invasive plant species (i.e. naïve natives). Here, I employ a meta-analysis to obtain a general pattern of inferred evolutionary responses of native plant species from 53 such studies. In general, the experienced natives had significantly higher growth/reproductive performances than naïve natives, when grown with or without competition from invasive plants. While the current results indicate that certain populations of native plant species could potentially adapt evolutionarily to invasive plant species, the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that probably underlie such evolutionary responses remain unexplored and should be the focus of future studies. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={The study of plant-insect interactions constitutes a large and growing branch of ecology that includes the two most diverse groups of higher organisms. This field of research addresses issues ranging from species-specific evolutionary arms races to the immense diversity of tropical plant communities to the effects of insect herbivores on reforestation. The time in plant ontogeny when these relationships are most influential is likely the vulnerable seedling stage because stored resources are scarce, effectively increasing negative effects of herbivory on plant growth and survival. This chapter examines the effects of seedling herbivory in the tropics, demonstrating the importance of herbivores to individual plant species as well as plant community composition; it closes by discussing the application of this knowledge to tropical forest restoration. Many, but not all, studies of seedling herbivory conclude that herbivore damage limits plant performance. In addition, abundant examples of plant adaptations to tolerate or avoid herbivory exist. For example, even young plants have strong chemical antiherbivore defenses, supporting the hypothesis that herbivory is costly to seedlings. The potential for herbivores to have positive effects on forest diversity is described in the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. According to this model, herbivores lead to enhanced diversity by negatively affecting seedling survival, particularly when conspecific seedlings are growing at high densities (negative density dependence) or near their parent plant (negative distance dependence). Few studies have explicitly tested the assumption that density dependent effects are mediated by herbivores, and even fewer have demonstrated resultant increases in diversity. However, new empirical support is emerging for the importance of herbivores in negative density and negative distance dependence. Herbivores also play a significant role in both actively managed and natural forest regeneration. For example, the growth of seedlings planted in reforestation is negatively affected by herbivory damage, and herbivores impact seedling survival and diversity in forests recovering from disturbances such as fire. Restoration projects could therefore benefit from explicitly considering ecological measures to manipulate herbivory. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can facilitate nutrient uptake and increase host plant growth but also place constraints on the host's carbon budget. When plants are stressed by herbivory the net effect of the symbiosis may be altered tolerance. Individual experiments manipulating AM fungi and herbivory have demonstrated increased, decreased, and no effect on tolerance but patterns with respect to plant, herbivore, or fungus characteristics have not emerged. Meta-analysis of published results from factorial experiments was used to describe the size of the effects of herbivory and of AM fungi on host growth when factors such as cause of damage, inoculum, and host characteristics are considered, and to determine whether AM fungi alter the effects of herbivory. Also, the correlation between the effect of AM fungi on tolerance and resistance was tested with data from studies that examined insect performance. Herbivory strongly and consistently reduced shoot and root growth, especially in perennial plants and crops. AM fungi increased shoot growth of perennials but not annuals, and when insects caused damage but not when artificial defoliation was applied. Root growth was consistently greater with AM fungi. The interaction of AM fungi and herbivory, which indicates whether AM fungi alter the effects of herbivory, was variable and never significant overall but homogeneity tests indicated underlying structure. In experiments that used single species inoculum, Glomus intraradices increased, whereas Glomus mosseae reduced, effects of herbivory on shoot growth. Multispecies inocula magnified effects of herbivory on root growth whereas single species inocula ameliorated effects. The impact of AM fungi on resistance to herbivory was positively correlated with the impact on tolerance; however AM fungi reduced both tolerance and resistance in many cases. Review of these results with respect to the types of systems studied suggests directions for future investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Summary: We review the effects of root and shoot competition on plant biomass by meta-analysis of 38 published studies, each reporting on the factorial effects of root-competition and shoot-competition on herbaceous plants. There were significant differences in the overall effects of root, shoot and full competition. Root competition generally resulted in larger biomass reduction than shoot competition, particularly among the smaller of the two competitors. An interaction between root and shoot competition was observed in some experiments but was generally not significant. While root competition was generally stronger than shoot competition at lower nutrient levels, there was no overall difference at higher nutrient levels due to much lower levels of root competition. In contrast, the overall effect of full competition increased considerably with nutrient level. Root competition was generally more important when the neighbour was a grass as compared with a herb or a legume, and when domesticated plants competed with wild neighbours, suggesting that wild genotypes are stronger competitors for below-ground resources than are crop plants. Effects of competition were generally stronger in experiments with additive designs than in those with substitutive designs. Also, experiments using single target individuals showed stronger effects of competition, root competition in particular, than did experiments using groups targets. Synthesis. Despite large variation among experiments, some general patterns were supported: effects of root competition are generally stronger than shoot competition, particularly (i) for smaller competitors, (ii) at low fertility levels, (iii) when the competitor is a grass rather than an herb, (iv) when the competitor is a wild rather than a domesticated species, and (v) in additive design experiments. The effects of root and shoot competition appear to be additive under many conditions. Whereas root competition may often be the primary limitation on mean plant performance, shoot competition will influence the variation around this mean and may determine which individuals or species dominate. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Anthropogenic modifications of the landscape, such as agriculture, are widespread globally and can reduce native biodiversity and homogenize communities by decreasing variation in species composition across sites. Partitioning anthropogenic impacts among species that have positive versus negative effects on plants may improve our ability to forecast the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these alterations in communities. Here, we manipulated the distance of populations of a wild sunflower species (Helianthus annuus texanus) to fields of its domesticated relative (crop sunflowers, H. annuus) and contrasted subsequent shifts in the abundance and community composition of mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (seed predators, folivores) of H. a. texanus. With some exceptions, populations of H. a. texanus near crop sunflowers supported higher numbers of pollinators than those far from crop sunflowers. In contrast, in the majority of cases, populations of H. a. texanus supported more seed predators when located far from crop sunflowers. Folivore damage to plants was greater far from crop sunflowers, and was never greater near crop sunflowers. Contrary to the prediction that proximity to agriculture homogenizes community composition, we found β-diversity of pollinators (species turnover between populations) was greater near crop sunflowers. Our results demonstrate that mutualists and antagonists of a wild plant species respond differently to the proximity of a related crop species, indicating the potential for both altered population dynamics and complex selection pressures on wild species in agricultural landscapes. © 2013 Chamberlain et al.},

abstract={Plants form ubiquitous associations with diverse microbes. These interactions range from parasitism to mutualism, depending partly on resource supplies that are being altered by global change. While many studies have considered the separate effects of pathogens and mutualists on their hosts, few studies have investigated interactions among microbial mutualists and pathogens in the context of global change. Using two wild grass species as model hosts, we grew individual plants under ambient or elevated CO2, and ambient or increased soil phosphorus (P) supply. Additionally, individuals were grown with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum, and after 2 wk, plants were inoculated or mock-inoculated with a phloem-restricted virus. Under elevated CO2, mycorrhizal association increased the titer of virus infections, and virus infection reciprocally increased the colonization of roots by mycorrhizal fungi. Additionally, virus infection decreased plant allocation to root biomass, increased leaf P, and modulated effects of CO2 and P addition on mycorrhizal root colonization. These results indicate that plant mutualists and pathogens can alter each other's success, and predict that these interactions will respond to increased resource availability and elevated CO2. Together, our findings highlight the importance of interactions among multiple microorganisms for plant performance under global change. © 2013 The Authors New Phytologist © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={Plant species introduced to new regions can escape their natural enemies but may also lose important mutualists. While mutualistic interactions are often considered too diffuse to limit plant invasion, few studies have quantified the strength of interactions in both the native and introduced ranges, and assessed whether any differences are linked to invasion outcomes. For three Acacia species adapted for ant dispersal (myrmecochory), we quantified seed removal probabilities associated with dispersal and predation in both the native (Australian) and introduced (New Zealand) ranges, predicting lower removal attributable to dispersal in New Zealand due to a relatively depauperate ant fauna. We used the role of the elaiosome to infer myrmecochory, and included treatments to measure vertebrate seed removal, since this may become an important determinant of seed fate in the face of reduced dispersal. We then tested whether differences in seed removal patterns could explain differences in the invasion success of the three Acacia species in New Zealand.Overall seed removal by invertebrates was lower in New Zealand relative to Australia, but the difference in removal between seeds with an elaiosome compared to those without was similar in both countries. This implies that the probability of a removed seed being dispersed by invertebrates was comparable in New Zealand to Australia. The probability of seed removal by vertebrates was similar and low in both countries. Differences in the invasive success of the three Acacia species in New Zealand were not explained by differences in levels of seed predation or the strength of myrmecochorous interactions. These findings suggest that interactions with ground foraging seed predators and dispersers are unlikely to limit the ability of Acacia species to spread in New Zealand, and could not explain their variable invasion success. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={While plants are invariably attacked by numerous insects and pathogens, the consequences of multiple enemies for plant performance are poorly understood. In particular, a predictive framework is lacking for when to expect enemies to have independent versus non-independent effects on their host plant. This is problematic for weed biological control programmes where multiple enemies are frequently released with the possibility of antagonistic interactions that may reduce control. Here, we conduct an analysis of 74 unique plant-enemy-enemy combinations from 51 studies to determine the frequency of non-independent effects of natural enemies on host plant performance, and test a number of a priori predictions for determinants of independent and antagonistic effects of multiple enemies. For three-quarters of plant response measurements, enemies had independent effects on plant performance. In most of the remainder, multiple enemies led to less reduction in performance than that predicted from each enemy alone. Antagonistic effects occurred when enemies attacked the same plant part concurrently or attacked plant reproductive structures. These two predictors explained why antagonistic effects were particularly prevalent for weeds, plants in the family Asteraceae and enemies in the order Diptera. Our results suggest that a few simple rules about avoiding particular combinations of multiple enemies could improve biological control success. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Many plants are simultaneously attacked by arthropod herbivores and phytopathogens. These may affect each other directly and indirectly, enhancing or reducing the amount of plant resources they each consume. Ultimately, this may reduce or enhance plant performance relative to what should be expected from the added impacts of herbivore and pathogen when they attack alone. Previous studies have suggested synergistic and antagonistic impacts on plant performance from certain combinations of arthropods and pathogens, for example, synergistic impacts from necrotrophic pathogens together with wounding arthropods because of facilitated infection and antagonistic impacts from induction of pathogen resistance by sucking herbivores. We compiled published studies on the impact of plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions on plant performance and used meta-analysis to search for consistent patterns of impacts among plant, herbivore and pathogen characteristics and experimental conditions, and to test the suggested hypotheses on synergistic or antagonistic impacts. None of the hypotheses based on proximate interactions between arthropods and pathogens were supported by our analysis; in contrast, the patterns we found were related to plant traits and experimental conditions. Our results suggest that immediate loss of resources from interactions between arthropod herbivores and pathogens is generally moderated by compensation to an extent where there are no interactive effects on plant performance. However, as interactive impacts also differed among environments and parasite manipulation methods, this suggests that the ability of plants to compensate such losses may depend on environmental conditions and probably also overall infection load. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Although plants are generally attacked by a community of several species of herbivores, relatively little is known about the strength of natural selection for resistance in multiple-herbivore communities-particularly how the strength of selection differs among herbivores that feed on different plant organs or how strongly genetic correlations in resistance affect the evolutionary responses of the plant. Here, we report on a field study measuring natural selection for resistance in a diverse community of herbivores of Solanum carolinense. Using linear phenotypic-selection analyses, we found that directional selection acted to increase resistance to seven species. Selection was strongest to increase resistance to fruit feeders, followed by flower feeders, then leaf feeders. Selection favored a decrease in resistance to a stem borer. Bootstrapping analyses showed that the plant population contained significant genetic variation for each of 14 measured resistance traits and significant covariances in one-third of the pairwise combinations of resistance traits. These genetic covariances reduced the plant's overall predicted evolutionary response for resistance against the herbivore community by about 60%. Diffuse (co)evolution was widespread in this community, and the diffuse interactions had an overwhelmingly constraining (rather than facilitative) effect on the plant's evolution of resistance. © 2013 The Author(s).

abstract={This chapter first describes the general effects and mediating mechanisms that root feeders and soil-borne symbionts can exert on the chemical ecology of above-ground plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions. It then discusses how the growth, development and host selection behaviour of parasitoids can be influenced by these soil-dwelling functional groups. In most empirical studies, the effects on parasitoids appear to be mediated by changes in primary and secondary above-ground plant metabolites and in herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), all induced by soil organisms. Finally, the chapter discusses how starting from a reductionist perspective and then expanding the spatial and temporal scales up to the level of communities and ecosystems can contribute to a better understanding of the assemblage and functioning of above-below-ground interactions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Ocean acidification and warming are considered two of the greatest threats to marine biodiversity, yet the combined effect of these stressors on marine organisms remains largely unclear. Using a meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation and combination. As expected biological responses varied across taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change experiments that incorporate interactions. Without them accurate predictions about the likely deleterious impacts to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning over the next century will not be possible. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={The majority of angiosperms are hermaphroditic with total fitness comprised of both male and female components of reproduction. However, most studies examining the effects of abiotic factors and species interactions on fitness have focussed on female reproduction, potentially biasing our understanding of the consequences of environmental factors on total fitness. Here, we use meta-analysis to test how environmental factors affect male function. We obtained 278 effect sizes from 96 studies that measured male function responses to manipulated environmental factors. We found significant effects of abiotic factors and species interactions on estimates of male function, with responses varying depending on environmental factor identity. Male and female responses were correlated for abiotic factor manipulations, but varied based on the type of species interaction (antagonistic or mutualistic). This suggests that measuring only female function may misrepresent whole-plant reproduction depending on context. Finally, we found differences amongst components of male function in response to environmental factors, suggesting that some male function estimates may fail to capture the effects of environmental factors on male fitness. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating male function into ecological and evolutionary studies to provide a more accurate understanding of the effects of environmental factors on total fitness. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Plants produce and emit a large variety of volatile organic compounds that play key roles in interactions with abiotic and biotic environments. One of these roles is the attraction of animals (mainly insects) that act as vectors of pollen to ensure reproduction. Here we update the current knowledge of four key aspects of floral emissions: (1) the relative importance and interaction of olfactory signals and visual cues, (2) the spatial and temporal patterns of emission in flowers, (3) the attractive and defensive functions of floral volatiles and their interference, and (4) the effects of global change on floral emissions and plant-pollinator interactions. Finally, we propose future lines of research in this field that need to be addressed or investigated further. © 2012 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract={We hypothesised that, for weed biological control, using species that feed as both adults and larvae would be advantageous. Here, we test the impacts of adult and larval feeding of Larinus minutus (Col.: Curculionidae), a successful biological control agent of diffuse knapweed, Centaurea diffusa (Asteraceae), in British Columbia, Canada. At one site, the observations of the present study showed that the intensity of adult weevil feeding did not predict the level of larval attack. Experiments found no evidence for plant-mediated competition between the life-history stages. At two sites and in two years, experimental manipulations of adult and/or larval feeding damage were conducted and plant performance measured. Neither antagonistic nor synergistic interactions occurred, but at each of the two sites a different life-history stage was responsible for reduction in the number of seeds produced by the plants. Although one of the two different feeding modes was redundant at each site, the ability of adults and larvae to reduce plant performance in different areas makes the species effective in a wider range of environments. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={Pollination is a key ecosystem service which most often has been studied in isolation although effects of pollination on seed set might depend on, and interact with, other services important for crop production. We tested three competing hypotheses on how insect pollination and pest control might jointly affect seed set: independent, compensatory or synergistic effects. For this, we performed a cage experiment with two levels of insect pollination and simulated pest control in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) grown for seed. There was a synergistic interaction between the two services: the gain in seed set obtained when simultaneously increasing pollination and pest control outweighed the sum of seed set gains obtained when increasing each service separately. This study shows that interactions can alter the benefits obtained from service-providing organisms, and this needs to be considered to properly manage multiple ecosystem services. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={After removing invasive plants, whether by herbicides or other means, typical restoration design focuses on rebuilding native plant communities while disregarding soil microbial communities. However, microbial-plant interactions are known to influence the relative success of native versus invasive plants. Therefore, the abundance and composition of soil microorganisms may affect restoration efforts. We assessed the effect of herbicide treatment on phytosymbiotic pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic (PPFM) bacteria and the potential consequences of native and invasive species establishment post-herbicide treatment in the lab and in a coastal sage scrub (CSS)/grassland restoration site. Lab tests showed that 4% glyphosate reduced PPFM abundance. PPFM addition to seeds increased seedling length of a native plant (Artemisia californica) but not an invasive plant (Hirschfeldia incana). At the restoration site, methanol addition (a PPFM substrate) improved native bunchgrass (Nassella pulchra) germination and size by 35% over controls. In a separate multispecies field experiment, PPFM addition stimulated the germination of N. pulchra, but not that of three invasive species. Neither PPFM nor methanol addition strongly affected the growth of any plant species. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that PPFMs have a greater benefit to native than invasive species. Together, these experiments suggest that methanol or PPFM addition could be useful in improving CSS/grassland restorations. Future work should test PPFM effects on additional species and determine how these results vary under different environmental conditions. Published 2011.

abstract={The effect of herbivory on plant performance is the subject of a large number of ecological studies, and plant responses to herbivory range from reduced reproduction to overcompensation. Because plant defenses, stored resources, and allocation demands change throughout a plant's lifetime, it can be hypothesized the effects of herbivory also vary with development. The present work extends previous analyses to incorporate hundreds of studies in a new meta-analysis addressing this topic. Herbivores had an overall negative effect on plant growth and reproduction, and, in contrast to a previous meta-analysis, this work shows the timing of herbivory is relevant. Differences in the effects of herbivory between life stages existed for woody plant reproduction and perennial herb growth. In addition, tree and shrub growth was reduced by herbivore damage at early ontogenetic stages, and perennial herb reproduction was limited by adult stage herbivory. These results partially support the continuum of an ontogenetic response model. Finally, consideration of this synthesis in conjunction with other work led to the conclusion that different plant groups optimize their defense investments in unique ways. Slow-growing plants may strongly chemically defend young tissues, supporting the plant-age hypothesis, because early herbivory is detrimental to growth. Faster-growing herbs may invest more in antiherbivore defense when they are older, supporting the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, because later herbivory limits their reproduction. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Genetic variation within and among foundation plant species is known to affect arthropod, plant and soil microbial communities. We hypothesized that the same would be expected for pathogen communities, which have typically been studied only as individual pathogen species. In a common garden in Utah, USA, we first tested how genetic differences within and among Populus angustifolia, P. fremontii and their interspecific hybrid P. × hinckleyana affect a fungal leaf pathogen community. Next, we tested how Populus genetic differences at the level of species and hybrids affect fungal leaf pathogen communities in the wild, specifically in a natural Populus hybridization zone (13 river km) and throughout the larger Weber River watershed (150 river km). In the common garden, genetic variation both within and among Populus species and hybrids significantly affected the structure (i.e. species abundances and composition) of pathogen communities. In the wild, genetic variation among Populus species and hybrids also significantly affected pathogen communities, though not as strongly as was found in the common garden environment. Stand-level density of the susceptible Populus species most strongly affected the structure of pathogen communities in the hybrid zone. Synthesis. Plant species and genotypic variation can affect the local and geographic distribution of pathogen communities in a similar fashion as other diverse organisms (e.g. arthropods, plants, soil microbes), both within a relatively controlled common garden environment and in the wild. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={An important challenge for conservation is a quantitative understanding of how multiple human stressors will interact to mitigate or exacerbate global environmental change at a community or ecosystem level. We explored the interaction effects of fishing, ocean warming, and ocean acidification over time on 60 functional groups of species in the southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic (amplified stress), additive (no additional stress), or antagonistic (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size, direction, and type of interaction effect varied depending on the combination of stressors. Top predator and fish biomass had a synergistic response to the interaction of all three stressors, whereas biomass of benthic invertebrates responded antagonistically. With our approach, we were able to identify the regional effects of fishing on the size and direction of the interacting effects of ocean warming and ocean acidification. ©2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Context Forests are important carbon sinks, but increasing temperatures may favour increases in insect populations, resulting in greater damage to trees. This, in turn, would lead to lower levels of carbon sequestration, intensifying global warming. & Aim It is therefore important to predict the impact of insect defoliation on tree growth accurately. The main insect defoliators of conifers in Southern Europe and North Africa are pine and cedar processionary moths (Lepidoptera, Thaumetopoeidae). & Method We conducted a meta-analysis based on 45 study cases, to estimate the effect of processionary moth defoliation on tree growth. & Result Overall, processionary moth defoliation had a significant impact on tree growth, regardless of the tree and moth species considered. Mean relative tree growth loss increased with the rate of defoliation levelling out at ca. 50 %; it was significantly larger for young than for old trees. & Conclusion These results suggest that estimates of processionary moth defoliation could easily be incorporated into tree growth models, to predict the effect of processionary moth outbreaks on carbon sequestration in Mediterranean forests. © INRA / Springer-Verlag France 2012.},

abstract={The majority of our understanding of mutualisms comes from studies of pairwise interactions. However, many hosts support mutualist guilds, and interactions among mutualists make the prediction of aggregate effects difficult. Here, we apply a factorial experiment to interactions of 'guard' crustaceans that defend their coral host from seastar predators. Predation was reduced by the presence of mutualists (15% reduction in predation frequency and 45% in volume of coral consumed). The frequency of attacks with both mutualists was lower than with a single species, but it did not differ significantly from the expected frequency of independent effects. In contrast, the combined defensive efficacy of both mutualist species reduced the volume of coral tissue lost by 73%, significantly more than the 38% reduction expected from independent defensive efforts, suggesting the existence of a cooperative synergy in defensive behaviors of 'guard' crustaceans. These emergent 'multiple defender effects' are statistically and ecologically analogous to the emergent concept of 'multiple predator effects' known from the predation literature. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Herbivores affect plants through direct effects, such as tissue damage, and through indirect effects that alter species interactions. Interactions may be positive or negative, so indirect effects have the potential to enhance or lessen the net impacts of herbivores. Despite the ubiquity of these interactions, the indirect pathways are considerably less understood than the direct effects of herbivores, and multiple indirect pathways are rarely studied simultaneously. We placed herbivore effects in a comprehensive community context by studying how herbivory influences plant interactions with antagonists and mutualists both aboveground and belowground. We manipulated early-season aboveground herbivore damage to Cucumis sativus (cucumber, Cucurbitaceae) and measured interactions with subsequent aboveground herbivores, root-feeding herbivores, pollinators, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We quantified plant growth and reproduction and used an enhanced pollination treatment to determine if plants were pollen limited. Increased herbivory reduced interactions with both antagonists and mutualists. Plants with high levels of early herbivory were significantly less likely to suffer leaf damage later in the summer and tended to be less attacked by root herbivores. Herbivory also reduced pollinator visitation, likely due to fewer and smaller flowers, and reduced AMF colonization. The net effect of herbivory on plant growth and reproduction was strongly negative, but lower fruit and seed production were not due to reduced pollinator visits, because reproduction was not pollen limited. Although herbivores influenced interactions between plants and other organisms, these effects appear to be weaker than the direct negative effects of early-season tissue loss. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Many biological control projects involve the release of multiple agents. Ageratina adenophora (crofton weed) has two agents, Procecidochares utilis, a stem gall fly, and Passalora ageratinae, a leaf-spot fungal pathogen, released against it in South Africa. This study investigated whether both agents, individually or jointly, increased or decreased the impact on crofton weed under greenhouse conditions. Six-month-old plants were exposed to one of six treatments (n= 15 plants/treatment): control (no agents), pathogen-only, single-galled only, double-galled only, pathogen-single-galled, and pathogen-double-galled, all for a period of 6. months. Individually, both of the agents reduced stem height and percentage of live leaves, but there was no synergistic effect of the two agents together. Pathogen-double-galled stems had significantly fewer pathogen-infected leaves relative to the other pathogen-infected treatment stems, suggesting a negative interaction between the two agents on pathogen establishment. Pathogen infection did not affect the size of the galls. Double galling by the fly inhibited stem growth above the gall position on the stem. Crofton weed compensated for galling by increasing the number of sideshoots. The pathogen inhibited sideshoot growth, thereby curbing the plant's ability to offset galling. Overall, there was an additive interaction between the two agents which enhances their usefulness as biocontrol agents of crofton weed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={• Soil-borne pathogens are a key component of the belowground community because of the significance of their ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, very little is known about the complexity of their distribution patterns in natural systems. Here, we explored the patterns, causes and ecological consequences of spatial variability in pathogen abundance in Mediterranean forests affected by oak decline. • We used spatially explicit neighborhood models to predict the abundance of soil-borne pathogen species (Phytophthora cinnamomi, Pythium spiculum and Pythium spp.) as a function of local abiotic conditions (soil texture) and the characteristics of the tree and shrub neighborhoods (species composition, size and health status). The implications of pathogen abundance for tree seedling performance were explored by conducting a sowing experiment in the same locations in which pathogen abundance was quantified. • Pathogen abundance in the forest soil was not randomly distributed, but exhibited spatially predictable patterns influenced by both abiotic and, particularly, biotic factors (tree and shrub species). Pathogen abundance reduced seedling emergence and survival, but not in all sites or tree species. • Our findings suggest that heterogeneous spatial patterns of pathogen abundance at fine spatial scale can be important for the dynamics and restoration of declining Mediterranean forests. © 2012 The Authors New Phytologist. © 2012 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={Mutualisms are well known to influence individual fitness and the population dynamics of partner species, but little is known about whether they influence species distributions and the location of geographic range limits. Here, we examine the contribution of plant-pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the geographic range consistently across four years of study. This decline in pollinator availability was caused to a greater extent by variation in the abundance of generalist rather than specialist bee pollinators. Climate data suggest that patterns of precipitation in the current and previous year drove variation in bee abundance because of its effects on cues for bee emergence in the current year and the abundance of floral resources in the previous year. Experimental floral manipulations showed that marginal populations had greater outcross pollen limitation of reproduction, in parallel with the decline in pollinator abundance. Although plants are self-compatible, we found no evidence that autonomous selfing contributes to reproduction, and thus no evidence that it alleviates outcross pollen limitation in marginal populations. Furthermore, we found no association between the distance to the range edge and selfing rate, as estimated from sequence and microsatellite variation, indicating that the mating system has not evolved in response to the pollination environment at the range periphery. Overall, our results suggest that dependence on pollinators for reproduction may be an important constraint limiting range expansion in this system. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Mutualisms often involve one host supporting multiple symbionts, whose identity, density and intraguild interactions can influence the nature of the mutualism and performance of the host. However, the implications of multiple co-occurring symbionts on services to a host have rarely been quantified. In this study, we quantified effects of decapod symbionts on removal of sediment from their coral host. Our field survey showed that all common symbionts typically occur as pairs and never at greater abundances. Two species, the crab Trapezia serenei and the shrimp Alpheus lottini, were most common and co-occurred more often than expected by chance. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test for effects of decapod identity and density on sediment removal. Alone, corals removed 10% of sediment, but removal increased to 30% and 48% with the presence of two and four symbionts, respectively. Per-capita effects of symbionts were independent of density and identity. Our results suggest that symbiont density is restricted by intraspecific competition. Thus, increased sediment removal from a coral host can only be achieved by increasing the number of species of symbionts on that coral, even though these species are functionally equivalent. Symbiont diversity plays a key role, not through added functionality but by overcoming density limitation likely imposed by intraspecific mating systems. © 2012 Stier et al.},

abstract={Host-specific mortality driven by natural enemies is a widely discussed mechanism for explaining plant diversity. In principle, populations of plant species can be regulated by distinct host-specific natural enemies that have weak or nonexistent effects on heterospecific competitors, preventing any single species from becoming dominant and thus promoting diversity. Two of the first steps in exploring the role of natural enemies in diversity regulation are to (1) identify potential enemies and (2) evaluate their levels of host specificity by determining if interactions between any one host and its enemy have equivalent survival impacts on co-occurring host species. We developed a bioinformatics framework to evaluate impacts of potential pathogens on seedling survival, for both single and multiple infections. Importantly, we consider scenarios not only if there are specialist pathogens for each plant, but also when generalist pathogens have differential effects on multiple host species, and when co-infection has species-specific effects. We then applied this analytical framework to a field experiment using molecular techniques to detect potential fungal pathogens on co-occurring tree seedling hosts. Combinatorial complexity created by 160 plant-fungus interactions was reduced to eight combinations that affect seedling survival. Potential fungal pathogens had broad host ranges, but seedling species were each regulated by different combinations of fungi or by generalist fungi that had differential effects on multiple plant species. Soil moisture can have the potential to shift the nature of the interactions in some plant-fungal combinations from neutral to detrimental. Reassessing the assumption of single-enemy-single-host interactions broadens the mechanisms through which natural enemies can influence plant diversity. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The relative abundance of traded resources can alter the outcomes of symbioses, potentially shifting mutually-beneficial interactions into interactions that are detrimental to one or both partners. We manipulated the legume-rhizobia symbiosis and light and nutrient levels to investigate how the net growth benefits to both partners shift across environments differing in the availability of both traded resources. In low nutrient, high light environments, rhizobia increased mean plant biomass by 62%. In contrast, when plants were light-limited, rhizobia did not increase above-ground biomass and reduced mean below-ground biomass by 46%. Similarly, rhizobia only increased plant biomass under low nutrient conditions. Resource availability also affected nodule traits correlated with rhizobia fitness, with light-limited plants producing fewer and smaller nodules. Our results suggest that the growth benefits to both partners in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis depend on the availability of both traded resources. We also detected evidence, however, that plants may reduce investment in symbionts as the net benefits of association decrease, potentially limiting how far this interaction shifts toward parasitism in low-light, high nutrient environments. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Growing interest in belowground herbivory and the remarkable diversity of the accumulated information on this topic inspired us to quantitatively explore the variation in the outcomes of individual studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of 85 experimental studies reporting the effects of root-feeding insect herbivores (36 species) on plants (75 species). On average, belowground herbivory led to a 36.3% loss of root biomass, which was accompanied by a reduction in aboveground growth (-16.3%), photosynthesis (-11.7%) and reproduction (-15.5%). The effects of root herbivory on aboveground plant characteristics were significant in agricultural and biological control studies, but not in studies of natural systems. Experiments conducted in controlled environments yielded larger effects on plants than field experiments, and infestation experiments resulted in more severe effects than removal studies employing natural levels of herbivory. Simulated root herbivory led to greater aboveground growth reductions than similar root loss imposed by insect feeding. External root chewers caused stronger detrimental effects than sap feeders or root borers; specialist herbivores imposed milder adverse effects on plants than generalists. Woody plants suffered from root herbivory more than herbaceous plants, although root loss was similar in these two groups. Evergreen woody plants responded to root herbivory more strongly than deciduous woody plants, and grasses suffered from root herbivory more than herbs. Environmental factors such as drought, poor nutrient supply, among-plant competition, and aboveground herbivory increased the adverse effects of root damage on plants in an additive manner. In general, plant tolerance to root herbivores is lower than tolerance to defoliating aboveground herbivores. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In many interspecific interactions, the balance of costs and benefits varies with ecological circumstances. As a prominent example, seed-caching granivores may act as seed predators and reduce plant recruitment or as seed dispersers and increase recruitment, making it difficult to interpret whether differences in seed removal by granivores would harm or benefit plant populations. We used a heuristic model to evaluate the outcome of plant-granivore interactions, using commonly measured field data: probability of seedling emergence when granivores are excluded, and emergence of cached and uneaten seeds. Published studies to date suggest that the outcome of plant-rodent interactions tends weakly towards mutualism, but differs among particular plant-granivore pairs and ecological conditions, supporting the notion of context-dependence. A modeling framework also allowed us to distinguish parameters that affect the qualitative outcome of plant-granivore interactions from those that do not. Similar approaches would facilitate more efficient and cost-effective evaluation of complex species interactions. © 2011 The Authors. Oikos © 2012 Nordic Society Oikos.},

abstract={Many species, both plants and animals, are simultaneously engaged in interactions with multiple mutualists. However, the extent to which separate traits that attract different mutualist guilds display negative or positive relationships remains largely unstudied. We asked whether correlations exist among extrafloral nectary traits to attract arthropod bodyguards and floral traits to attract pollinator mutualists. For 37 species in the cotton genus (Gossypium), we evaluated correlations among six extrafloral nectary traits and four floral traits in a common greenhouse environment, with and without correction for phylogenetic non-independence. Across Gossypium species, greater investment in extrafloral nectary traits was positively correlated with greater investment in floral traits. Positive correlations remained after accounting for the evolutionary history of the clade. Our results demonstrate that traits to maintain multiple mutualist guilds can be positively correlated across related species and build a more general understanding of the constraints on trait evolution in plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Aims In nature, plant communities are affected simultaneously by a variety of functionally dissimilar organisms both above and below the ground. However, there is a gap of knowledge on interactive effects of functionally dissimilar organisms on plant communities that is needed to be filled to better understand and predict the general impact of biotic factors on plant communities. Methods We conducted a full-factorial mesocosm study to investigate the individual and combined impacts of above-and belowground functionally dissimilar organisms on a grassland plant community. We studied the effects of aboveground herbivores (Helix aspersa, Gastropoda), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomus spp., Glomeromycota) and endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea spp., Lumbricidae) on the diversity, structure and productivity of an experimental grassland plant community and each other.Important FindingsAboveground herbivory by snails decreased, AMF increased and earthworms had no effects on the diversity of the grassland plant community, while their combined effects were additive. The biomass of the plant community was negatively affected by snails and AMF, while no effects of earthworms or interaction effects were found. The plant species were differently affected by snails and AMF. No effects of the above-and belowground organisms on each other's performance were detected. Since the effects of the functionally dissimilar organisms on the grassland plant community were mainly independent, the results indicate that their combined effects may be predicted by knowing the individual effects, at least under the conditions used in the present mesocosm study. © 2011 The Author.},

abstract={Soil communities associated with specific plant species affect individual plants' growth and competitive ability. Limited evidence suggests that unique soil communities can also differentially influence growth and competition at the ecotype level. Previous work with Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that accessions produce distinct and reproducible rhizosphere bacterial communities, with significant differences in both species composition and relative abundance. We tested the hypothesis that soil communities uniquely affect the growth and reproduction of the plant accessions with which they are associated. Specifically, we examined the growth of four accessions when exposed to their own soil communities and the communities generated by each of the other three accessions. To do this we planted focal accessions inside a ring of six plants that created a "background" soil community. We grew focal plants in this design in three separate soil treatments: non-sterile soil, sterilized soil, and "preconditioned" soil. We preconditioned soil by growing accessions in non-sterile soil for six weeks before the start of the experiment. The main experiment was harvested after seven weeks of growth and we recorded height, silique number, and dry weight of each focal plant. Plants grown in the preconditioned soil treatment showed less growth relative to the non-sterile and sterile soil treatments. In addition, plants in the sterile soil grew larger than those in non-sterile soil. However, we saw no interaction between soil treatment and background accession. We conclude that the soil communities have a negative net impact on Arabidopsis thaliana growth, and that the unique soil communities associated with each accession do not differentially affect growth and competition of study species. © 2011 Aguilera et al.

abstract={A common effect size metric used to quantify the outcome of experiments for ecological meta-analysis is the response ratio (RR): the log proportional change in the means of a treatment and control group. Estimates of the variance of RR are also important for meta-analysis because they serve as weights when effect sizes are averaged and compared. The variance of an effect size is typically a function of sampling error; however, it can also be influenced by study design. Here, I derive new variances and covariances for RR for several often-encountered experimental designs: when the treatment and control means are correlated; when multiple treatments have a common control; when means are based on repeated measures; and when the study has a correlated factorial design, or is multivariate. These developments are useful for improving the quality of data extracted from studies for metaanalysis and help address some of the common challenges meta-analysts face when quantifying a diversity of experimental designs with the response ratio. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Current competition theory does not adequately address the fact that competitors may affect the survival, growth, and reproductive rates of their resources. Ecologically important interactions in which consumers affect resource vital rates range from parasitism and herbivory to mutualism. We present a general model of competition that explicitly includes consumer-dependent resource vital rates. We build on the classic MacArthur model of competition for multiple resources, allowing direct comparison with expectations from established concepts of resource-use overlap. Consumers share a stagestructured resource population but may use the different stages to different extents, as they do the different independent resources in the classic model. Here, however, the stages are dynamically linked via consumer-dependent vital rates. We show that consumers' effects on resource vital rates result in two important departures from classic results. First, consumers can coexist despite identical use of resource stages, provided each competitor shifts the resource stage distribution toward stages that benefit other species. Second, consumers specializing on different resource stages can compete strongly, possibly resulting in competitive exclusion despite a lack of resource stage-use overlap. Our model framework demonstrates the critical role that consumerdependent resource vital rates can play in competitive dynamics in a wide range of biological systems. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={The availability and quality of mutualists beyond a species' range edge may limit range expansion. With the legume Chamaecrista fasciculata, we asked to what extent the availability and quality of rhizobia beyond the range edge limits host range expansion. We tested the effect of rhizobia availability on plant growth by transplanting seed from three locations into five sites spanning C. fasciculata's range (interior, at the northern and western range edges, and beyond the range edges), and inoculating half the seeds with rhizobia. We recorded growth of all surviving plants, and, for the uninoculated plants, whether they had formed nodules or not. We isolated rhizobia from nodules collected on the uninoculated plants, and cross-inoculated seed from four populations (both range edge and interior populations) in the greenhouse to determine whether the quality of rhizobia differed between regions. We found that seeds transplanted beyond the range edge were less likely to be nodulated when they were not experimentally inoculated, and there was benefit to inoculation at all sites. In the greenhouse, the three inocula that formed nodules on plants, from the range interior, northern edge and beyond the northern edge, did not detectably differ in their effect on plant growth. These results suggest that low densities of suitable rhizobia beyond the range edge may limit range expansion of legume species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The interactions between herbivores and plants are of general interest in ecology. Even though the extensive research carried out during the last decades has culminated in many theories, additional studies are necessary to validate these findings. In particular, the hypotheses dealing with the complex interrelations of plant defense mechanisms and herbivores continue to be debated. In this paper, we develop a new indicator value that quantifies the defense mechanisms of Central European woody plants against large mammalian herbivores. The indicator value is based on three plant-specific traits: chemical defense (toxic compounds, digestion inhibitors), mechanical defense and leaf size. Our validation of the newly established indicator shows that evergreen woody plants have a significantly higher indicator value than deciduous woody plants. Moreover, plant defense is correlated with growth height: woody plants growing in the browsing zone preferred by large mammalian herbivores have significantly higher levels of defense compared with woody plants capable of growth high above the reach of large herbivores. We conclude that the new plant defense indicator value is a valuable tool for the validation of existing hypotheses and habitat calibration on a statistical basis. The quantification of plant mechanisms of defense against large herbivores produces a significantly better understanding of the multifaceted nature of plant-animal interactions and should contribute positively to future studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Neotyphodium endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are common constituents of natural grasslands. The plant-endophyte symbiosis can introduce changes in soil conditions that affect the density and activity of different functional groups of soil organisms. In the present work we performed in vitro assays to evaluate the effect of root and endophyte exudates on the pre-infective state of mycorrhizal fungi (Gigaspora margarita and G. rosea). Plant roots of Bromus setifolius from populations of Patagonia, and four strains of Neotyphodium were used to obtain the exudates. Root exudates of infected plants, at a high concentration, significantly increased AMF hyphal branches and length relative to exudates from naturally endophyte free plants. The effect of Neotyphodium endophyte exudates on AMF mycelial length varied depending on strain and the concentration used, suggesting a differential interaction between endophyte and AMF species. AMF hyphal branches were increased by Neotyphodium fungal exudates in both mycorrhizal species. A few previous studies have suggested that Neotyphodium endophytes can reduce mycorrhizal sporulation and colonization of host roots in commonly-cultivated agronomic hosts. In this study we report the opposite effect in B. setifolius. This study reports the direct and positive effect of root exudates from plants in symbiosis with Neotyphodium, on AMF pre-infective state. Further, identical effects were detected using exudates from Neotyphodium endophytes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Premise of the study: Plants interact with above- and belowground organisms; the combined effects of these interactions determine plant fitness and trait evolution. To better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of multispecies interactions, we explored linkages between soil fungi, pollinators, and floral larcenists in Polemonium viscosum (Polemoniaceae). Methods: Using a fungicide, we experimentally reduced fungal colonization of krummholz and tundra P. viscosum in 2008 - 2009. We monitored floral signals and rewards, interactions with pollinators and larcenists, and seed set for fungicide-treated and control plants. Key results: Fungicide effects varied among traits, between interactions, and with environmental context. Treatment effects were negligible in 2008, but stronger in 2009, especially in the less-fertile krummholz habitat. There, fungicide increased nectar sugar content and damage by larcenist ants, but did not affect pollination. Surprisingly, fungicide also enhanced seed set, suggesting that direct resource costs of soil fungi exceed indirect benefits from reduced larceny. In the tundra, fungicide effects were negligible in both years. However, pooled across treatments, colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in 2009 correlated negatively with the intensity and diversity of floral volatile organic compounds, suggesting integrated above- and belowground signaling pathways. Conclusions: Fungicide effects on floral rewards in P. viscosum link soil fungi to ecological costs of pollinator attraction. Traitspecific linkages to soil fungi should decouple expression of sensitive and buffered floral phenotypes in P. viscosum. Overall, this study demonstrates how multitrophic linkages may lead to shifting selection pressures on interaction traits, restricting the evolution of specialization. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract={Many antagonistic species attack plants and consume specific plant parts. Understanding how these antagonists affect plant fitness individually and in combination is an important research focus in ecology and evolution. We examined the individual and combined effects of herbivory, nectar robbing, and pre-dispersal seed predation on male and female estimates of fitness in the host plant Ipomopsis aggregata. By examining the effects of antagonists on plant traits, we were able to tease apart the direct consumptive effects of antagonists versus the indirect effects mediated through changes in traits important to pollination. In a three-way factorial field experiment, we manipulated herbivory, nectar robbing, and seed predation. Herbivory and seed predation reduced some male and female fitness estimates, whereas plants tolerated the effects of robbing. The effects of herbivory, robbing, and seed predation were primarily additive, and we found little evidence for non-additive effects of multiple antagonists on plant reproduction. Herbivory affected plant reproduction through both direct consumptive effects and indirectly through changes in traits important to pollination (i. e., nectar and phenological traits). Conversely, seed predators primarily had direct consumptive effects on plants. Our results suggest that the effects of multiple antagonists on estimates of plant fitness can be additive, and investigating which traits respond to damage can provide insight into how antagonists shape plant performance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This study investigated the potential of a root rot causing fungal pathogen to affect the geographical distribution of plant species. A glasshouse experiment was conducted that compared the responses of congeneric plant species of contrasting range types to the presence or absence of a soil borne fungal pathogen at three different moisture levels. Five congeneric plant species pairs were selected, each with one species present and one absent in humid western Europe: Centaurea scabiosa-C. stoebe, Dianthus deltoides-D. carthusianorum, Inula conyzae-I. hirta, Potentilla neumanniana-P. cinerea and Scabiosa columbaria-S. ochroleuca. The oomycete Pythium ultimum was selected as the root rot causing soil borne pathogen because of its wide geographical distribution, wide host range and reported preference for high soil moisture. The response variables measured included relative growth rates of above- and belowground biomass, leaf number and the shoot-root ratio. Two plant species pairs (Dianthus and Scabiosa) showed a significant interaction of distribution type with presence of the pathogen. The species with a continental distribution suffered a greater reduction in growth due to the pathogen than the species with an oceanic distribution. However, across all species and genera the pathogen's effect was not dependent on range type or soil moisture and affected only RGR of leaf number. The study revealed that unspecialized fungal pathogens might have an effect on the performance of some plant species and might affect continentally distributed species more than oceanic ones, which might put them at disadvantage when combined with, for example, competition. Nevertheless, this effect was not recorded for all genera tested. Given the little knowledge on the effects of unspecialized pathogens on wild plant species, further studies with different soil borne fungal pathogens causing root rot and an enlarged set of plant species are recommended.},

abstract={Although the primary function of mating is gamete transfer, male ejaculates contain numerous other substances that are produced by accessory glands and transferred to females during mating. Studies with several model organisms have shown that these substances can exert diverse behavioural and physiological effects on females, including altered longevity and reproductive output, yet a comprehensive synthesis across taxa is lacking. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to synthesize quantitatively extensive experimental work examining how male ejaculate quantity affects different components of female fitness. We summarize effect sizes for female fecundity (partial and lifetime) and longevity from 84 studies conducted on 70 arthropod species that yielded a total of 130 comparisons of female fecundity and 61 comparisons of female longevity. In response to greater amounts of ejaculate, arthropod females demonstrate enhanced fecundity (both partial and lifetime) but reduced longevity, particularly for Diptera and Lepidoptera. Across taxa, multiply mated females show particularly large fecundity increases compared to singly mated females, indicating that single matings do not maximize female fitness. This fecundity increase is balanced by a slight negative effect on lifespan, with females that received more ejaculate through polyandrous matings showing greater reductions in lifespan compared with females that have mated repeatedly with the same male. We found no significant effect size differences for either female fecundity or longevity between taxa that transfer sperm packaged into spermatophores compared to taxa that transfer ejaculates containing free sperm. Furthermore, females that received relatively larger or more spermatophores demonstrated greater lifetime fecundity, indicating that these seminal nuptial gifts provide females with a net fitness benefit. These results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary origin and maintenance of non-sperm ejaculate components, and provide insight into female mate choice and optimal mating patterns. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Interactions between species pairs are almost always mediated by interactions with other species. The outcomes of these multispecies interactions are often difficult to predict and are rarely studied. In addition to their theoretical importance, multispecies interactions are also important for management situations. Where multiple agents are used to control invasive species, interactions between agents may either enhance or reduce the impacts on the target species, or may simply have additive effects. In this study, conducted in a Mediterranean-type woodland in Australia, we examined how the interaction between an invasive legume, Cytisus scoparius (Leguminosae), its pollinator, Apis mellifera and a seed predator, Bruchidius villosus (Bruchidae), are modified by a native hemiparasitic vine, Cassytha pubescens (Loranthaceae). The parasite had a direct negative effect on C. scoparius, reducing flowering by 50% and consequently fruit and seed production. Despite having fewer flowers, infected plants had the same proportion of 'tripped' flowers, an indirect measure of pollinator visitation, as uninfected plants; although fruit formed on infected plants it was more likely to abort prematurely. Seed predation by B. villosus was lower on parasite-infected C. scoparius plants than in uninfected plants. Although Ca. pubescens had an antagonistic effect on B. villosus, in consort, the two agents reduced overall seed production by an average of 62%. The acquired parasite Ca. pubescens was more effective in reducing reproductive output than the introduced seed predator, B. villosus, and shows potential as a biocontrol agent for C. scoparius. We documented a subadditive effect of two biological enemies on the invasive species, where the acquired parasite had a stronger effect than the introduced seed predator. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Mutualisms are best understood from a community perspective, since third-party species have the potential to shift the costs and benefits in interspecific interactions. We manipulated plant genotypes, the presence of rhizobium mutualists, and the presence of a generalist herbivore and assessed the performance of all players in order to test whether antagonists might alter the fitness benefits of plant-rhizobium mutualism, and vice versa how mutualists might alter the fitness consequences of plant-herbivore antagonism. We found that plants in our experiment formed more associations with rhizobia (root nodules) in the presence of herbivores, thereby increasing the fitness benefits of mutualism for rhizobia. In contrast, the effects of rhizobia on herbivores were weak. Our data support a community-dependent view of these ecological interactions, and suggest that consideration of the aboveground herbivore community can inform ecological and evolutionary studies of legume-rhizobium interactions. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Recent studies of mutualism have emphasized both that the net benefit to participants depends on the ecological context and that the density-dependent pattern of benefit is key to understanding the population dynamics of mutualism. Indeed, changes in the ecological context are likely to drive changes in both the magnitude of benefit and the densitydependent pattern of benefit. Despite the close linkage between these two areas of research, however, few studies have addressed the factors underlying variation in the density-dependent pattern of benefit. Here I use model selection to evaluate how variation in the benefits of a mutualism drives temporal variation in the density-dependent pattern of net benefit for the ant-tended treehopper Publilia concava. In the interaction between ants and treehoppers in the genus Publilia, ants collect the sugary excretions of treehoppers as a food resource, and treehoppers benefit both directly (e.g., by feeding facilitation) and indirectly (e.g., by predator protection). Results presented here show that temporal changes in the relative magnitude of direct and indirect benefit components of ant tending, especially the effectiveness of predator protection by ants, qualitatively change the overall pattern of density-dependent benefit between years with maximum benefit shifting from treehoppers in small to large aggregations. These results emphasize the need for empirical studies that evaluate the long-term dynamics of mutualism and theoretical studies that consider the population dynamics consequences of variation in the density-dependent pattern of benefit. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Plants infected with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes carry their microbial symbionts with them during dispersal into new areas. Yet, whether seed-borne endophytes enhance the host plant's ability to overcome colonisation barriers and to regenerate within invaded sites remains poorly understood. We examined how symbiosis with asexual endophytic fungi (Neotyphodium) affected establishment and seed loss to predators in the invasive annual grass Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) across contrasting successional plots. Italian ryegrass seeds with high and low endophyte incidence were sown into three communities: a 1-year-old fallow field, a 15-year-old grassland, and a 24-year-old forest, which conformed to an old-field chronosequence in the eastern Inland Pampa, Argentina. We found that endophyte infection consistently increased host population recruitment and reproductive output. Endophyte presence also enhanced aerial biomass production of ryegrass in a low recruitment year but not in a high recruitment year, suggesting that symbiotic effects on growth performance are density dependent. Endophyte presence reduced seed removal by rodents, although differential predation may not account for the increased success of infected grass populations. Overall, there was no statistical evidence for an endophyte-by-site interaction, indicating that the fungal endosymbiont benefitted host establishment regardless of large differences in biotic and abiotic environment among communities. Our results imply that hereditary endophytes may increase the chances for host grass species to pass various ecological filters associated with invasion resistance across a broad range of successional habitats. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Invasive plants may be attacked both above ground and below ground. Few studies have, however, investigated the simultaneous effects of above-ground and below-ground herbivory. In the present study, we report the effects of beetle herbivory and nematode infection on alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides, an invasive plant in China. We found that the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita widely occurred on the plant in south China. To examine its effect on the plant in conjunction with above-ground herbivory, we conducted a field common garden experiment with a local insect defoliator, Cassida piperata. We also included the native congener Alternanthera sessilis in our experiments for a comparison of the response of invasive and native species. We found no significant effects on plant biomass of the nematode infection in conjunction with the above-ground herbivory. Further chemical analysis, however, showed that the water-soluble carbohydrate content in roots of A. philoxeroides was significantly increased in plants attacked by both the nematode and the herbivore compared with the water-soluble carbohydrate content in plants attacked by only the nematode or herbivore alone. We found no such change in the native congener A. sessilis. Together these results may suggest that A. philoxeroides tolerates joint above-ground and below-ground damage by allocating more resources to below-ground material. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={The continuing exponential increase in scientific knowledge, the growing availability of large databases containing raw or partially annotated information, and the increased need to document impacts of large-scale research and funding programs provide a great incentive for integrating and adding value to previously published (or unpublished) research through quantitative synthesis. Meta-analysis has become the standard for quantitative evidence synthesis in many disciplines, offering a broadly accepted and statistically powerful framework for estimating the magnitude, consistency, and homogeneity of the effect of interest across studies. Here, we review previous and current uses of meta-analysis in plant pathology with a focus on applications in epidemiology and disease management. About a dozen formal meta-analyses have been published in the plant pathological literature in the past decade, and several more are currently in progress. Three broad research questions have been addressed, the most common being the comparative efficacy of chemical treatments for managing disease and reducing yield loss across environments. The second most common application has been the quantification of relationships between disease intensity and yield, or between different measures of disease, across studies. Lastly, metaanalysis has been applied to assess factors affecting pathogen-biocontrol agent interactions or the effectiveness of biological control of plant disease or weeds. In recent years, fixed-effects meta-analysis has been largely replaced by random-(or mixed-) effects analysis owing to the statistical benefits associated with the latter and the wider availability of computer software to conduct these analyses. Another recent trend has been the more common use of multivariate meta-analysis or meta-regression to analyze the impacts of study-level independent variables (moderator variables) on the response of interest. The application of meta-analysis to practical problems in epidemiology and disease management is illustrated with case studies from our work on Phakopsora pachyrhizi on soybean and Erwinia amylovora on apple. We show that although meta-analyses are often used to corroborate and validate general conclusions drawn from more traditional, qualitative reviews, they can also reveal new patterns and interpretations not obvious from individual studies. © 2011 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract={The tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivores and avian predators are complex and prone to trophic cascades. We conducted a meta-analysis of original articles that have studied birds as predators of invertebrate herbivores, to compare top-down trophic cascades with different plant responses from different environments and climatic areas. Our search found 29 suitable articles, with a total of 81 separate experimental study set-ups. The meta-analysis revealed that plants benefited from the presence of birds. A significant reduction was observed in the level of leaf damage and plant mortality. The presence of birds also positively affected the amount of plant biomass, whereas effects on plant growth were negligible. There were no differences in the effects between agricultural and natural environments. Similarly, plants performed better in all climatic areas (tropical, temperate and boreal) when birds were present. Moreover, both mature plants and saplings gained benefits from the presence of birds. Our results show that birds cause top-down trophic cascades and thus they play an integral role in ecosystems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Interactions between competitors, predators and their prey have traditionally been viewed as the foundation of community structure. Parasites - long ignored in community ecology - are now recognized as playing an important part in influencing species interactions and consequently affecting ecosystem function. Parasitism can interact with other ecological drivers, resulting in both detrimental and beneficial effects on biodiversity and ecosystem health. Species interactions involving parasites are also key to understanding many biological invasions and emerging infectious diseases. This book bridges the gap between community ecology and epidemiology to create a wide-ranging examination of how parasites and pathogens affect all aspects of ecological communities, enabling the new generation of ecologists to include parasites as a key consideration in their studies. This comprehensive guide to a newly emerging field is of relevance to academics, practitioners and graduates in biodiversity, conservation and population management, and animal and human health. © M.

abstract={The link between reproductive and vegetative ecology of flowering plants is rarely explored, despite its importance for understanding population processes and fitness. This link can be studied by using experimental or natural variation in seed input to the soil to assess how reproductive success affects vital rates of offspring. We previously reported for Ipomopsis aggregata that per-seed probability of germinating is insensitive to density of seeds sown into plots, whereas per capita flower production among adults that grow from the seedlings declines in nonlinear fashion with density. Here we describe a parallel non-experimental study. We related seedling emergence to estimated natural seed input ('seed rain') in three populations across ten summers and monitored seedlings that emerged in the first two summers throughout their life histories. Seedling emergence in 1996 was linearly related to seed rain from plants that flowered in 1995. This density independent seed-to-seedling transition recurred over the next nine summers, but the slope varied with springtime precipitation. Total numbers of 1996 seedlings that survived to flower and numbers of flowers they produced increased linearly with seed rain in one population, but did not vary detectably in the other two, consistent with negative density dependence. In consequence λ (the dominant eigenvalue of a population projection matrix) decreased from high values at low densities of seed rain to a relatively constant low value with greater seed rain. We also detected density dependence in the 1995 seedling cohort in survival and flower production. The similarity of results from natural and experimental studies supports a conclusion of nonlinear density dependence and shows that characterizing it requires the full life history. For this plant species and others, studies of pollination and fecundity alone may not suffice to draw conclusions about population change or fitness. © 2010 The Authors.},

abstract={Competition experiments estimating the relative effects of inter- and intraspecific competition can help to resolve whether interspecific competition results in coexistence or exclusion. For mosquitoes, most such experiments have focused on invasive Aedes albopictus and its interactions with resident Aedes. A meta-analysis of such experiments tested whether the effect of interspecific competition is greater than, less than, or equal to that of intraspecific competition, and whether competitive outcomes are dependent on food quality. For A. albopictus and A. aegypti, there was significant context dependence, with interspecific competitive advantage for A. albopictus with low food quality, and competitive equivalence with high food quality. Meta-analysis of survivorship yielded more significant effects than did estimated rate of increase. Competitive effects and competitive responses of each species yielded similar results. This meta-analysis suggests competitive exclusion of A. aegypti by A. albopictus, and is thus consistent with field sampling, qualitative reviews, and interpretations from individual publications. For A. albopictus and A. triseriatus, most results indicated competitive equivalence and no context dependence, and are thus contrary to previous qualitative reviews and to interpretations from individual publications. For both pairs of species, published results suitable for meta-analysis remain scarce, and better experimental designs and improved analysis and reporting of statistical results are needed. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on estimating species' inter- and intraspecific competitive effects, rather than the more common, but theoretically less interesting, competitive responses. Experiments without low-density controls (i.e., replacement series) are inadequate for comparing competitive effects and responses.},

abstract={Insect herbivores and fungal pathogens can independently affect plant fitness, and may have interactive effects. However, few studies have experimentally quantified the joint effects of insects and fungal pathogens on seed production in nonagricultural populations. We examined the factorial effects of insect herbivore exclusion (via insecticide) and fungal pathogen exclusion (via fungicide) on the population-level seed production of four common graminoid species (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Poa pratensis, and Carex siccata) over two growing seasons in Minnesota, USA. We detected no interactive effects of herbivores and pathogens on seed production. However, the seed production of all four species was affected by either insecticide or fungicide in at least one year of the study. Insecticide consistently doubled the seed production of the historically most common species in the North American tallgrass prairie, A. gerardii (big bluestem). This is the first report of insect removal increasing seed production in this species. Insecticide increased A. gerardii number of seeds per seed head in one year, and mass per seed in both years, suggesting that consumption of flowers and seed embryos contributed to the effect on seed production. One of the primary insect species consuming A. gerardii flowers and seed embryos was likely the Cecidomyiid midge, Contarinia wattsi. Effects on all other plant species varied among years. Herbivores and pathogens likely reduce the dispersal and colonization ability of plants when they reduce seed output. Therefore, impacts on seed production of competitive dominant species may help to explain their relatively poor colonization abilities. Reduced seed output by dominant graminoids may thereby promote coexistence with subdominant species through competition-colonization tradeoffs. © 2010 Dickson, Mitchell.},

abstract={Understanding cooperation is a central challenge in biology, because natural selectionshouldfavor "free-loaders" that reap benefits without reciprocating. For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a "sterilization parasite" that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these "parasites" enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation.},

abstract={In nature, plants often associate with multiple symbionts concurrently, yet the effects of tripartite symbioses are not well understood. We expected synergistic growth responses from plants associating with functionally distinct symbionts. In contrast, symbionts providing similar benefits to a host may reduce host plant growth. We reviewed studies investigating the effect of multiple interactions on host plant performance. Additionally, we conducted a meta-analysis on the studies that performed controlled manipulations of the presence of two microbial symbionts. Using response ratios, we investigated the effects on plants of pairs of symbionts (mycorrhizal fungi, fungal endophytes, and nitrogen-fixers). The results did not support the view that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and rhizobia should interact synergistically. In contrast, we found the joint effects of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to be greater than expected given their independent effects. This increase in plant performance only held for antagonistic endophytes, whose negative effects were alleviated when in association with AM fungi, while the impact of beneficial endophytes was not altered by infection with AM fungi. Generalizations from the meta-analysis were limited by the substantial variation within types of interactions and the data available, highlighting the need for more research on a range of plant systems. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Interactions between biological control agents and how they impact on their invasive plant hosts have received little research attention. This study examined the individual and combined effects of the rust fungus Puccinia myrsiphylli (Thuem.) Wint. and an undescribed leafhopper (Tribe Erythroneurini, formerly referred to as Zygina sp.) introduced for the biological control of the invasive plant bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides (L.) Druce) in Australia. Bridal creeper is a geophyte with extensive rhizomes and tubers from which climbing foliage is produced annually. The response of individual bridal creeper plants following exposure to the agents was measured in exclusion experiments in a glasshouse (using cages) and in the field (using pesticides). In the glasshouse experiment, the two agents acting together had an additive impact on all growth parameters measured, except the above-ground biomass for which an effect equivalent to that caused by the rust fungus alone was observed. The agents acted synergistically in reducing the relative growth rate of rhizome length, tuber number and tuber biomass. Depletion of storage organs occurred in treatments comprising the rust fungus solely or both agents. While phytotoxicity occurred in treatments involving insecticide applications in the field experiment, results from the other treatments corresponded with those of the glasshouse experiment. In both experiments, leafhopper damage decreased as infection by the rust fungus increased. This study provides additional evidence of the potential gains to be made from deploying multiple biological control agents where they can partition the target resources in space and/or time. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Plants interact with numerous enemies and mutualists simultaneously and sequentially. Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Adaptive phenotypic plasticity allows sessile organisms such as plants to match trait expression to the particular environment they experience. Plasticity may be limited, however, by resources in the environment, by responses to prior environmental cues, or by previous interactions with other species, such as competition or herbivory. Thus, understanding the expression of plastic traits and their effects on plant performance requires evaluating trait expression in complex environments, rather than across levels of a single variable. In this study, we tested the independent and combined effects of two components of a plant's environment, herbivory and water availability, on the expression of attractive and defensive traits in Nicotiana quadrivalvis in the greenhouse. Damage and drought did not affect leaf nicotine concentrations but had additive and non-additive effects on floral attractive and defensive traits. Plants in the high water treatment produced larger flowers with more nectar than in the low water treatment. Leaf damage induced greater nectar volumes in the high water treatment only, suggesting that low water limited plastic responses to herbivore damage. Leaf damage also tended to induce higher nicotine concentrations in nectar, consistent with other studies showing that leaf damage can induce floral defenses. Our results suggest that there are separate and synergistic effects of leaf herbivory and drought on floral trait expression, and thus plasticity in response to complex environments may influence plant fitness via effects on floral visitation and defense. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Protection mutualisms often involve multiple species of protector that vary in quality as mutualists. Because protectors may compete for access to mutualists, concordance between competitive ability and degree of benefit will determine the overall strength of multi-species mutualisms. We compared the abilities of two similarly sized congener ants as competitors for, and mutualists of pine-feeding aphids, and how insectivorous birds affected each ant-aphid mutualism. Formica planipilis and F. podzolica were indistinguishable in forager abundance, but the former was 13-fold more abundant at competition baits and provided 11-fold more benefits to aphids. These results highlight how, in a single environment, a great ecological distance can exist between two congener ants of similar size. Insectivorous birds disrupted the two mutualisms to a similar extent, reducing aphid and ant abundance by 91% and 39% respectively. Nevertheless, birds had an important influence on the relative benefits of the two ants to aphids: where F. planipilis consistently benefited aphids, F. podzolica only did so in the absence of birds. Consequently, the presence of insectivorous birds and ant species identity jointly determined whether ant-aphid mutualisms occurred in pine canopies and the strength of such interactions. Our study highlights the inter-relatedness of competition, predation and mutualism, and how competition can serve to strengthen mutualism by filtering inferior mutualists. © 2009 The Authors.},

abstract={The raw material for evolution is variation. Consequently, identifying the factors that generate, maintain, and erode phenotypic and genetic variation in ecologically important traits within and among populations is important. Although persistent directional or stabilizing selection can deplete variation, spatial variation in conflicting directional selection can enhance variation. Here, we present evidence that phenotypic variation in limber pine (Pinus flexilis) cone structure is enhanced by conflicting selection pressures exerted by its mutualistic seed disperser (Clark's nutcracker Nucifraga columbiana) and an antagonistic seed predator (pine squirrel Tamiasciurus spp.). Phenotypic variation in cone structure was bimodal and about two times greater where both agents of selection co-occurred than where one (the seed predator) was absent. Within the region where both agents of selection co-occurred, bimodality in cone structure was pronounced where there appears to be a mosaic of habitats with some persistent habitats supporting only the seed disperser. These results indicate that conflicting selection stemming from spatial variation in community diversity can enhance phenotypic variation in ecologically important traits. © 2009 The Author(s).

abstract={The population dynamics of invasive plants are influenced by positive and negative associations formed with members of the fauna present in the introduced range. For example, mutualistic associations formed with pollinators or seed dispersers may facilitate invasion, but reduced fitness from attack by native herbivores can also suppress it. Since population expansion depends on effective seed dispersal, interactions with seed dispersers and predators in a plant species introduced range may be of particular importance. We explored the relative contributions of potential seed dispersers (ants) and vertebrate predators (rodents and birds) to seed removal of two diplochorous (i.e., wind- and ant-dispersed), invasive thistles, Cirsium arvense and Carduus nutans, in Colorado, USA. We also conducted behavior trials to explore the potential of different ant species to disperse seeds, and we quantified which potential ant dispersers were prevalent at our study locations. Both ants and vertebrate predators removed significant amounts of C. arvense and C. nutans seed, with the relative proportion of seed removed by each guild varying by location. The behavior trials revealed clear seed preferences among three ant species as well as differences in the foragers' abilities to move seeds. In addition, two ant species that acted as potential dispersal agents were dominant at the study locations. Since local conditions in part determined whether dispersers or predators removed more seed, it is possible that some thistle populations benefit from a net dispersal effect, while others suffer proportionally more predation. Additionally, because the effectiveness of potential ant dispersers is taxon-specific, changes in ant community composition could affect the seed-dispersal dynamics of these thistles. Until now, most studies describing dispersal dynamics in C. arvense and C. nutans have focused on primary dispersal by wind or pre-dispersal seed predation by insects. Our findings suggest that animal-mediated dispersal and post-dispersal seed predation deserve further consideration. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Mycorrhizal fungi influence plant growth, local biodiversity and ecosystem function. Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this variation in symbiotic function using meta-analysis with information theory-based model selection to assess the relative importance of factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its functional characteristics, (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal), (3) soil fertility, (4) biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory vs. field). Across most subsets of the data, host plant functional group and N-fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation ('plant response') than other factors. Non-N-fixing forbs and woody plants and C4 grasses responded more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N-fixing bacterial symbionts and C3 grasses. In laboratory studies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, plant response was more positive when the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are P-limited rather than N-limited. These results emphasize that mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context, and have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={High herbivore pressure is expected to benefit unpalatable species that co-occur with palatable browsed species. However, for five unpalatable understory species we found no evidence of benefit from deer browse. Detailed studies of one species in natural populations, Arisaema triphyllum, revealed surprising changes in its population structure and demography: deer browse level on a palatable species significantly correlates with reduced plant size and seed rain and male-biased sex ratios of co-occurring Arisaema populations. Analyses of individual size in five unpalatable forest plant species in long-term experimental paired deer exclosure/deer access plots corroborate the natural site results; all five species were smaller in deer access plots. Analyses of abiotic variables in natural and experimental sites suggest one potential mechanism for indirect effects of deer. Deer-mediated soil quality declines included increased soil penetration resistance and decreased leaf litter depth, which are known to hinder plant growth. Our results are likely applicable to other unpalatable forest species and have clear consequences for understory biodiversity. Unpalatable plant species in forests experiencing high deer numbers may be in decline along with their palatable neighbors.

abstract={Background and AimsBiological mutualisms rely on communication between partners, but also require protective measures against exploitation. Animal-pollinated flowers need to attract pollinators but also to avoid conflicts with antagonistic consumers. The view of flower visitors as mutualistic and antagonistic agents considers primarily the plants' interest. A classification emphasizing the consumer's point of view, however, may be more useful when considering animal's adaptations to flower visits which may include a tolerance against defensive floral scent compounds. MethodsIn a meta-analysis covering 18 studies on the responses of animals to floral scents, the animals were assigned to the categories of obligate and facultative flower visitors which considers their dependency on floral resources. Their responses on floral scents were compared. Key ResultsOn average, obligate flower visitors, often corresponding to pollinators, were attracted to floral scent compounds. In contrast, facultative and mainly antagonistic visitors were strongly repelled by floral scents. The findings confirm that floral scents have a dual function both as attractive and defensive cues. ConclusionsWhether an animal depends on floral resources determines its response to these signals, suggesting that obligate flower visitors evolved a tolerance against primarily defensive compounds. Therefore, floral scent bouquets in conjunction with nutritious rewards may solve the conflicting tasks of attracting mutualists while repelling antagonists. © The Author 2010.

abstract={Question: What is the effect of level of host inbreeding on fungal root colonization? Hypothesis: Selfed plants are poorer hosts than outcrossed ones and should be less intensively colonized. Organism: Hermaphroditic individuals of the self-compatible wild strawberry Fragaria virginiana (Rosaceae). Methods: Selfed and outcrossed progeny were grown at three resource levels. Plants were scored for vegetative size, leaf disease, and root fungi in semi-natural conditions. Results: Hyphal colonization was greater in outcrossed than in selfed plants, but the effect was marginal for vesicular colonization. Neither resource level nor maternal genotype influenced the effect of plant inbreeding on colonization. But fungi associated with plants in high resources produced more vesicles. Inbreeding depression in plant vegetative size was positively correlated with cross differential root colonization. © 2010 Carine L. Collin.},

abstract={A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications, such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings, the " one host-one pathogen" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how impacts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources (cultures, gene sequencing, and survival observations), and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence, infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. We demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts, where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing. © 2009 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},

abstract={1. Traditionally, techniques of plant manipulation during restoration have focused on the reduction of competition by 'problematic' existing vegetation. However, the increasing recognition of facilitation as a main process regulating the composition of communities has brought a change in the practice of restoration towards a better awareness of the benefits inherent to conserving neighbouring vegetation. 2. Here, I provide the results of a meta-analysis of published studies that have manipulated interactions among plants with the objective of restoring degraded terrestrial systems. I created four different data sets corresponding to the variables most commonly used to measure plant performance (i.e. emergence, survival, growth and density), and asked whether the benefits of facilitation as a restoration tool vary depending on the study duration, the life-form of the neighbour and target species, and the ecosystem type. 3. Neighbour effects varied strongly among performance estimators. Positive effects were frequently found for emergence and survival, whereas neutral or negative interactions predominated for growth and density. 4. No clear support existed for a relationship between study duration and neighbour effect. 5. The life-form of the interacting species, particularly of neighbours, largely influenced the interaction outcome. Herbs had strong negative effects, especially on other herb species, whereas shrubs had large facilitative effects, especially on trees. 6. Semiarid and tropical systems showed in general more positive neighbour effects than wetlands and particularly mesic temperate systems, where negative interactions predominated. However, these results were largely influenced by the over-representation of herb species in wetlands and temperate habitats, survival facilitation being found in all systems when only woody species were considered. 7. Synthesis. Pre-existing vegetation can have large impacts on species establishment in degraded habitats. Inhibition predominates in herbaceous communities typical of early-successional stages, whereas facilitation prevailes in communities dominated by shrubs and trees. Even productive systems (e.g. mesic temperate habitats) appear suitable for the application of facilitation as a restoration tool of woody communities. Whereas restoring herbaceous communities seems largely reliable on removal techniques, augmenting populations of nurse shrubs and trees should be considered a promising strategy for restoring woody late-successional communities. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Context dependency, variation in the outcome of species interactions with biotic and abiotic conditions, is increasingly considered ubiquitous among mutualisms. Despite several qualitative reviews of many individual empirical studies, there has been little quantitative synthesis examining the generality of context dependency, or conditions that may promote it. We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context-dependent effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth, reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater than 0. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however. Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extrafloral nectar, food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory were greater in tropical vs. temperate systems. Although ant-plant interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta-analyses, indicate that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic interactions. Rather, ant-plant protection mutualisms appear to be routinely positive for plants, and only occasionally neutral. © 2009 by the Ecological society of America.},

abstract={Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Interactions between natural enemy species may modify their net effect on host plants, but little research has been done to examine how plant resistance influences species interactions in biological weed control. We performed common garden experiments with clonal accessions of Chondrilla juncea to compare a rust-susceptible weed biotype with a rust-resistant biotype, both of which are invasive in western North America. Inoculations with two biological control organisms, a rust fungus pathogen (Puccinia chondrillina) and an eriophyid gall mite (Eriophyes chondrillae), were applied separately and in combination to test if plant performance is modified by antagonistic or facilitative species interactions. We found no significant rust × mite interaction effects for several plant traits (shoot length, shoot dry biomass, fecundity, rosette growth, and rosette senescence), and therefore the two natural enemies appear to have independent and complementary effects on plant performance. As expected, genetic resistance of weed biotypes modified the effects of rust disease on shoots and rosettes, although not for plant fecundity. We found no significant biotype × mite effects on plant performance traits. However, rust inoculation reduced the total dry biomass of mite galls in the rust-susceptible biotype by indirect competition due to decreased growth of diseased shoots, but not in the rust-resistant biotype. Our results indicate that rust disease may have the potential to modify mite gall epidemiology and relative plant performance in mixed populations of resistant and susceptible C. juncea biotypes, though at present the geographic distributions of these North American biotypes are mainly separate. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Background and Aims Although the ecological and evolutionary consequences of foliar herbivory are well understood, how plants cope with floral damage is less well explored. Here the concept of tolerance, typically studied within the context of plant defence to foliar herbivores and pathogens, is extended to floral damage. Variation in tolerance to floral damage is examined, together with some of the mechanisms involved. Methods The study was conducted on Ipomopsis aggregata, which experiences floral damage and nectar removal by nectar-robbing bees. High levels of robbing can reduce seeds sired and produced by up to 50 %, an indirect effect mediated through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants. Using an experimental common garden with groups of I. aggregata, realized tolerance to robbing was measured. Realized tolerance included both genetic and environmental components of tolerance. It was hypothesized that both resource acquisition and storage traits, and traits involved in pollination would mitigate the negative effects of robbers. Key Results Groups of I. aggregata varied in their ability to tolerate nectar robbing. Realized tolerance was observed only through a component of male plant reproduction (pollen donation) and not through components of female plant reproduction. Some groups fully compensated for robbing while others under- or overcompensated. Evidence was found only for a pollination-related trait, flower production, associated with realized tolerance. Plants that produced more flowers and that had a higher inducibility of flower production following robbing were more able to compensate through male function. Conclusions Variation in realized tolerance to nectar robbing was found in I. aggregata, but only through an estimate of male reproduction, and traits associated with pollination may confer realized tolerance to robbing. By linking concepts and techniques from studies of plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, this work provides insight into the role of floral traits in pollinator attraction as well as plant defence. © 2009 The Author.},

abstract={Plant communities can be affected both by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and hemiparasitic plants. However, little is known about the interactive effects of these two biotic factors on the productivity and diversity of plant communities. To address this question, we set up a greenhouse study in which different AMF inocula and a hemiparasitic plant (Rhinanthus minor) were added to experimental grassland communities in a fully factorial design. In addition, single plants of each species in the grassland community were grown with the same treatments to distinguish direct AMF effects from indirect effects via plant competition. We found that AMF changed plant community structure by influencing the plant species differently. At the community level, AMF decreased the productivity by 15-24%, depending on the particular AMF treatment, mainly because two dominant species, Holcus lanatus and Plantago lanceolata, showed a negative mycorrhizal dependency. Concomitantly, plant diversity increased due to AMF inoculation and was highest in the treatment with a combination of two commercial AM strains. AMF had a positive effect on growth of the hemiparasite, and thereby induced a negative impact of the hemiparasite on host plant biomass which was not found in non-inoculated communities. However, the hemiparasite did not increase plant diversity. Our results highlight the importance of interactions with soil microbes for plant community structure and that these indirect effects can vary among AMF treatments. We conclude that mutualistic interactions with AMF, but not antagonistic interactions with a root hemiparasite, promote plant diversity in this grassland community. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Ask airline passengers what they see as they gaze out the window, and they will describe a fragmented landscape: a patchwork of desert, woodlands, farmlands, and developed neighborhoods. Once-contiguous forests are now subdivided; tallgrass prairies that extended for thousands of miles are now crisscrossed by highways and byways. Whether the result of naturally occurring environmental changes or the product of seemingly unchecked human development, fractured lands significantly impact the planet's biological diversity. In Ecology of Fragmented Landscapes, Sharon K. Collinge defines fragmentation, explains its various causes, and suggests ways that we can put our lands back together. Researchers have been studying the ecological effects of dismantling nature for decades. In this book, Collinge evaluates this body of research, expertly synthesizing all that is known about the ecology of fragmented landscapes. Expanding on the traditional coverage of this topic, Collinge also discusses disease ecology, restoration, conservation, and planning. Not since Richard T. T. Forman's classic Land Mosaics has there been a more comprehensive examination of landscape fragmentation. Ecology of Fragmented Landscapes is critical reading for ecologists, conservation biologists, and students alike. © 2009 The Johns Hopkins University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we report molecular investigation of an ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) community of European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) seedlings grown in a bare-root nursery. In total, we surveyed 32 nurseries that were each active in supplying planting stocks to restock forests and for afforestation of post-agricultural land. Sequence-based approach was used to identify EMF taxa, quantify EMF richness, and document differences in the relative abundance of individual taxa. We identified seven fungal species that might contribute to the mycorrhizal community structure of 1 to 3-year-old L. decidua seedlings. The species richness in the examined larches varied between one and four fungal taxa, depending on both the nursery stock samples (NSS) and age class of the seedlings. The average was 1.4 for 1-year-old seedlings and 2.3 for 2- and 3-year-old plants. The dominance of Ascomycota over Basidiomycota and the prevalence of two species, Wilcoxina mikolae and Suillus grevillei, as EMF partners were characteristic features of nursery-grown L. decidua seedlings. S. grevillei was the only one basidiomycetes colonized roots of tested seedlings. The rest of the mycorrhizal pool from forest nurseries was typically dominated by pioneer fungal ascomycetes. W. mikolae was the most common mycorrhizal ascomycete present at a high frequency on NSS from both age classes and with very high abundance (average 90%) on 1-year-old seedlings. Some other ascomycetes (Pezizales 1, Pezizales 2 and Pezizales 3) appeared on tested larches at a low frequency, but sometimes in high abundance. Tuber spp. appeared at a low frequency and low abundance. The relative abundance of S. grevillei was positively correlated with the age of seedlings, while W. mikolae was negatively correlated with age. Tuber sp. 1 and 2, Pezizales 2, and W. mikolae were positively associated with the basic soil pH values. However, forward selection of the environmental variables showed that only the age of the larch seedlings contributed significantly (F = 11.45, P = 0.02) to the variance in the ECF community. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Tolerance of foliar damage is widely recognized as an effective defense against herbivores and pathogens. However, tolerance of the impacts of antagonists on pollination success is less well understood. Here, we extend the framework of tolerance to foliar damage to understand how plants mitigate the pollination and fitness costs of floral larceny (i.e., the consumption of floral nectar often without pollination). We focused on two mechanisms: high nectar rewards per flower to feed all floral visitors and high flower production to compensate for reproductive losses under reduced pollination and seed set. We compared the efficacy of these mechanisms in two plant species: Polemonium viscosum and Ipomopsis aggregata. In Polemonium, ants acting as larcenists reduce nectar accumulation but do not completely empty flowers. When nectar reserves were augmented, ant consumption increased, negating the efficacy of this putative tolerance mechanism. Similarly, in Ipomopsis, nectar addition had little effect on tolerance to larceny by bumble bees, perhaps because residual intact flowers do not have enough nectar to compensate for lost rewards. Flower production in both species mitigated some of the negative impacts of larceny on seed set. In Polemonium, flower number was not plastic in response to larceny, but large inflorescences enhanced female fitness only when larcenists were present, suggesting that "surplus" flowers in large inflorescences can function to replace reproductive losses due to larceny. In Ipomopsis, high rates of larceny induced flower production, but the fecundity benefits of making more flowers declined inversely to larcenist intensity. Overall, our results suggest (1) that tolerance to floral larceny involves "banking" extra flowers to replace lost reproduction rather than maintaining pollination of ones with larceny, and (2) that the efficacy of flower production as a tolerance mechanism varies inversely to larceny rate. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Plants can change soil biology, chemistry and structure in ways that alter subsequent plant growth. This process, referred to as plant-soil feedback (PSF), has been suggested to provide mechanisms for plant diversity, succession and invasion. Here we use three meta-analytical models: a mixed model and two Bayes models, one correcting for sampling dependence and one correcting for sampling and hierarchical dependence (delta-splitting model) to test these hypotheses. All three models showed that PSFs have medium to large negative effects on plant growth, and especially grass growth, the life form for which we had the most data. This supports the hypothesis that PSFs, through negative frequency dependence, maintain plant diversity, especially in grasslands. PSFs were also large and negative for annuals and natives, but the delta-splitting model indicated that more studies are needed for these results to be conclusive. Our results support the hypotheses that PSFs encourage successional replacements and plant invasions. Most studies were performed using monocultures of grassland species in greenhouse conditions. Future research should examine PSFs in plant communities, non-grassland systems and field conditions. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Ecological theory holds that competition and predation are the most important biotic forces affecting the composition of communities. Here, we expand this framework by demonstrating that mutualism can fundamentally alter community and food web structure. In large, replicated field plots, we manipulated the mutualism between a dominant plant (Lolium arundinaceum) and symbiotic fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum). The presence of the mutualism reduced arthropod abundance up to 70%, reduced arthropod diversity nearly 20%, shifted arthropod species composition relative to endophyte-free plots and suppressed the biomass and richness of other plant species in the community. Herbivorous arthropods were more strongly affected than carnivores, and for both herbivores and carnivores, effects of the mutualism appeared to propagate indirectly via organisms occurring more basally in the food web. The influence of the mutualism was as great or greater than previously documented effects of competition and predation on arthropod communities. Our work demonstrates that a keystone mutualism can significantly reduce arthropod biodiversity at a broad community scale. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Theory predicts that, with conflicting selection pressures mediated by mutualists and antagonists, alternative reproductive strategies can be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection if it results in rare-morph advantage. We combined field experiments and surveys of natural populations to determine whether selection on floral display is frequency dependent in the self-incompatible herb Primula farinosa, which is polymorphic for inflorescence height and occurs in a short-scaped and a long-scaped morph. Among short-scaped plants, both pollination success, quantified as initiation of fruits and seeds, and seed predation were positively correlated with the relative frequency of the long-scaped morph. The relative strength of these effects and the direction of the resulting frequency-dependent selection on scape morph varied among years and populations. The results suggest that both mutualists and antagonists may mediate frequency-dependent selection and that frequency dependence may vary from positive to negative with rare-morph advantage, depending on the relative strength of these interactions. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Pathogens are thought to promote diversity in plant communities by preventing competitive exclusion. Previous studies have focussed primarily on single-plant, single-pathogen interactions, yet the interactions between multiple pathogens and multiple hosts may have non-additive impacts on plant community composition. Here, we report that both a bacterial and a fungal pathogen maintained the diversity of a four-species plant community across five generations; however, significant interactions between the pathogens resulted in less plant diversity when the two pathogens were present than when the fungal pathogen was present alone. Standard models predict that pathogens will maintain plant diversity when they cause a disproportionate loss of fitness in the dominant plant species. In our experiment, however, pathogens maintained plant diversity because the rare species produced more seeds through a compensatory response to pathogen infection. Finally, we found that the influence of pathogens on maintaining plant diversity was 5.5 times greater than the influence of nutrient resource heterogeneity. Pathogens may be a major factor in maintaining plant diversity, and our findings emphasize the importance of investigating the roles of pathogens in natural plant communities. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms into body size classes or by using whole communities from different origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms, nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non-leguminous forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes. Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not affected by soil organisms, but Lotus corniculatus flowered earlier in the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by counterbalancing the negative effects of plant-feeding nematodes on grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may cancel out each other in functionally diverse soil communities. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Predicting ecosystem responses to global change is a major challenge in ecology. A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level. Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling through community processes, but predicting how such changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the community response to environmental change (predicted by response traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species' response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental change on function. We then detail several key research directions needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. These include (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities worldwide make such a research agenda imperative. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Animals that consume plant parts or rewards but provide no services in return are likely to have significant impacts on the reproductive success of their host plants. The effects of multiple antagonists to plant reproduction may not be predictable from studying their individual effects in isolation. If consumer behaviors are contingent on each other, such interactions may limit the ability of the host to evolve in response to any one enemy. Here, we asked whether nectar robbing by a bumblebee (Bombus occidentalis) altered the likelihood of pre-dispersal seed predation by a fly (Hylemya sp.) on a shared host plant, Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae). We estimated the fitness consequences of the combined interactions using experimental manipulations of nectar robbing within and among sites. Within sites, nectar robbing reduced the percentage of fruits destroyed by Hylemya. However, the negative effects of robbing on seed production outweighed any advantages associated with decreased seed predation in robbed plants. We found similar trends among sites when we manipulated robbing to all plants within a local population, although the results were not statistically significant. Taken together, our results suggest that seed predation is not independent of nectar robbing. Thus, accounting for the interactions among species is crucial to predicting their ecological effects and plant evolutionary response. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Hypothesis: Repellent floral volatiles are responsible for ants' conspicuous absence from flowers. Organisms: A broad spectrum of flowers (32 species for volatiles, 72 for nectar tests) was screened for their effect on different ant species. Methods: The ants' responses to floral scent bouquets and to individual floral volatiles were tested in a modified Pettersson four-arm olfactometer. Flower nectar was extracted with micro-capillaries and offered to ants to observe whether they accepted or rejected the nectar. Results: While ants readily consumed almost all nectar offered to them, they were significantly repelled by a high proportion of floral scent bouquets. Repellent effects were confirmed for individual terpenoids commonly found in floral scents. Repellent floral scents provided an unequivocal explanation for the distribution of Formica rufibarbis ants among nectar-bearing flowers in situ. Conclusions: This is the first clear demonstration that ant repellence from flowers is triggered by naturally emitted floral volatiles. This suggests that floral scents may function as allomones against enemies and not solely as synomones to attract mutualists. © 2008 Nico Blüthgen.},

abstract={Successful plant invasions are often attributed to increased plant size, reproduction, or release from natural enemies, but the generality and persistence of these patterns remains widely debated. Meta-analysis was used to quantitatively assess invasive plant performance and release from enemy damage and how these change with residence time and geographic distribution. Invasive plants were compared either in their introduced and home ranges or with native congeners in the introduced range. Invasive plants in the introduced range were generally larger, allocated more to reproduction, and had lower levels of herbivore damage compared with conspecifics in the home range; pathogen attack, however, varied widely. In congener comparisons, invasive and native plants did not differ in size or herbivory, but invaders did allocate less to reproduction and had lower levels of pathogen damage. Time since introduction was a significant nonlinear predictor of enemy release for both herbivores and pathogens, with initial release in recently arrived species and little to no release after 50 to 200 years. Geographic distribution was also a significant nonlinear predictor of enemy release. The observed nonlinear relationships are consistent with dynamic invasions and may define targets for eradication efforts if these patterns hold up for individual species. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={The outcome of species interactions is often difficult to predict, depending on the organisms involved and the ecological context. Nectar robbers remove nectar from flowers, often without providing pollination service, and their effects on plant reproduction vary in strength and direction. In two case studies and a meta-analysis, we tested the importance of pollen limitation and plant mating system in predicting the impacts of nectar robbing on female plant reproduction. We predicted that nectar robbing would have the strongest effects on species requiring pollinators to set seed and pollen limited for seed production. Our predictions were partially supported. In the first study, natural nectar robbing was associated with lower seed production in Delphinium nuttallianum, a self-compatible but non-autogamously selfing, pollen-limited perennial, and experimental nectar robbing reduced seed set relative to unrobbed plants. The second study involved Linaria vulgaris, a self-incompatible perennial that is generally not pollen limited. Natural levels of nectar robbing generally had little effect on estimates of female reproduction in L. vulgaris, while experimental nectar robbing reduced seed set per fruit but not percentage of fruit set. A meta-analysis revealed that nectar robbing had strong negative effects on pollen-limited and self-incompatible plants, as predicted. Our results suggest that pollination biology and plant mating system must be considered to understand and predict the ecological outcome of both mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions.},

abstract={Plants are members of complex communities and interact both with antagonists and beneficial organisms. An important question in plant defense-signaling research is how plants integrate signals induced by pathogens, beneficial microbes and insects into the most appropriate adaptive response. Molecular and genomic tools are now being used to uncover the complexity of the induced defense signaling networks that have evolved during the arms races between plants and their attackers. Molecular biologists and ecologists are joining forces to place molecular mechanisms of plant defense into an ecological perspective. Here, we review our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of induced plant defense and their potential ecological relevance in nature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
