Abstract = {{In recent decades, myriad studies have explored the population dynamics
   of coevolving populations of predator and prey. A variety of choices are
   made in these models: exponential or logistic prey growth in the absence
   of a predator, various forms of predator functional response, and uni-
   or bi-directional trait axes. In addition, some form of trade-offs are
   assumed in order to prevent run-away evolution of the prey and predator
   traits. While there is a considerable amount of theory regarding various
   forms of prey growth rates and predator functional responses, only a few
   studies have explored how different types of trade-offs affect
   predator-prey dynamics. Here, we compared two ditrophic coevolution
   models incorporating different trade-offs via dual effects of the prey
   trait on attack rate and either prey carrying capacity or intrinsic
   growth rate. We employed a standard dynamical systems approach to
   analyze the equilibrium conditions of each model and find conditions for
   non-equilibrium oscillatory coexistence. The exact effect of various
   parameters on the outcome of predator-prey interactions depends on
   whether the trade-offs affect the intrinsic growth rate or carrying
   capacity. In particular, coexistence is more likely when prey growth
   rate is affected by the evolving trait. In addition, in parameter
   regimes where cycles occur in both models, oscillations typically have
   larger periods and amplitudes when prey growth rate is affected by the
   evolving trait. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions among multiple anthropogenic stressors threaten freshwater
   fish and pose challenges for fisheries management and conservation.
   Previous studies of multiple-stressor effects on freshwater fish suggest
   a prevalence of antagonistic interactions. However, taxonomy, life stage
   and/or environmental context likely modify the magnitude and direction
   of fish responses to multiple stressors. Stressor intensity, impact
   mechanism, exposure time and ecosystem size may further affect
   interaction outcomes. Large-scale studies quantifying how these
   variables moderate stressor interactions are lacking. To address this
   knowledge gap, we performed a meta-analysis of 29 factorial
   multiple-stressor experiments to examine the influence of seven
   potential moderator variables on the magnitude and direction of stressor
   interactions. Using weighted random-effects meta-analytic models, we
   demonstrate the importance of taxonomic identity and life stage for
   interaction outcomes. In particular, Cypriniformes showed stronger
   antagonisms than Salmoniformes, as did larval fish compared to
   juveniles. Interaction outcomes also varied among the measured fish
   responses with survival yielding stronger antagonisms than biomass.
   Increasing experimental duration and volume of the experimental units
   both drove interactions towards synergisms, supporting findings from
   previous studies that synergisms take time and space to develop. In an
   era when the number of stressors affecting freshwater systems is
   increasing rapidly, our study provides a vital step towards identifying
   generalities in multiple-stressor outcomes and thus improved predictions
   of multiple-stressor impacts. Furthermore, our meta-analysis complements
   studies in real streams, rivers and lakes by providing an experimentally
   derived context for the growing number of multiple-stressor assessments
   in research, management and conservation of freshwater fish.}},

Abstract = {{When entering a new community, introduced species leave behind members
   of their native community while simultaneously forming novel biotic
   interactions. Escape from enemies during the process of introduction has
   long been hypothesized to drive the increased performance of invasive
   species. However, recent studies and quantitative syntheses find that
   invaders often receive similar, or even more, damage from enemies than
   do native species. Therefore, invasives may be those more tolerant to
   enemy damage, or those able to maintain competitive ability in light of
   enemy damage. Here, we investigate whether tolerance and competitive
   ability could contribute to invasive plant success. We determined
   whether invasive plants were more competitive than native or noninvasive
   exotic species in both the presence and absence of simulated herbivory.
   We found competition and herbivory additively reduced individual
   performance, and affected the performance of native, invasive, and
   noninvasive exotic species' to the same degree. However, invasives
   exerted stronger competitive effects on an abundant native species
   (Elymus canadensis) in both the presence and absence of herbivory.
   Therefore, while invasive species responded similarly to competition and
   simulated herbivory, their competitive effects on natives may contribute
   to their success in their introduced range.}},

Title = {{Cascading effects of a top predator on intraspecific competition at

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2241-2252}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Predators can impact competition among prey by altering prey density
   via consumption or by causing prey to modify their traits or foraging
   behavior. Yet, differences between these two mechanisms may lead to
   different cascading impacts on lower trophic levels.
   2. Using a crab-snail-barnacle rocky intertidal food chain, we tested
   the effects of predation risk from crabs (top predators) on
   intraspecific competition among snails (intermediate consumers) and
   emergent indirect effects on the density of and competition among
   barnacles (basal resources).
   3. The per capita foraging and growth rates of snails declined with high
   conspecific density. Predation risk from crabs, which caused even larger
   reductions in snail foraging and growth, weakened competition among
   snails, whereas a 45\% increase in barnacle density had no detectable
   effect on snail competition.
   4. Intraspecific competition between barnacles, however, depended on the
   interactive effects of barnacle density, snail density, and crab
   predation risk. Barnacles developed hummocking morphologies as they grew
   and competed for space. Hummock formation (a proxy for competition)
   increased as a result of either greater initial barnacle density or
   reduced snail foraging pressure, but these effects depended on predation
   risk.
   5. The effects of crab predation risk on snail foraging behavior
   weakened an otherwise strong relationship between barnacle density and
   hummock development: hummocking increased with barnacle density in the
   absence of crabs but remained relatively high when crabs were present.
   In communities with similar final barnacle densities, hummocking was
   more common in those with crabs than those without crabs.
   6. The extent to which predators can drive trophic cascades by
   suppressing the foraging rates of their prey is highly
   context-dependent: the positive trait-mediated indirect effect of
   predators on basal resource abundance is stronger when many prey respond
   simultaneously to the threat of predation. However, our results
   demonstrate that top predators can also enhance competition among basal
   resources even when their indirect effect on resource abundance is
   relatively weak. Hence, the cascading effects of predators on
   competition within lower trophic levels may play an important but
   under-appreciated role in the dynamics of basal resource populations and
   the communities they support.}},

Abstract = {{Plants interact simultaneously with each other and with soil biota, yet
   the relative importance of competition vs. plant-soil feedback (PSF) on
   plant performance is poorly understood. Using a meta-analysis of 38
   published studies and 150 plant species, we show that effects of
   interspecific competition (either growing plants with a competitor or
   singly, or comparing inter- vs. intraspecific competition) and PSF
   (comparing home vs. away soil, live vs. sterile soil, or control vs.
   fungicide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly
   negative, broadly comparable in magnitude, and additive or synergistic.
   Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker
   competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific
   competition), suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance
   and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants
   growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indicating
   that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour
   identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might
   interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen
   competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance
   facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we
   provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic water turbidity derived from suspended solids (SS) is
   caused by reservoir sediment management practices such as drawdown
   flushing. Turbid water induces stress in many aquatic organisms, but the
   effects of turbidity on oxidative stress responses in aquatic insects
   have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we examined antioxidant responses,
   oxidative damage, and energy reserves in caddisfly (Stenopsyche
   marmorata) larvae exposed to turbid water (0 mg SS L-1, 500 mg SS L-1,
   and 2000 mg SS L-1) at different temperatures. We evaluated the combined
   effects of turbid water and temperature by measuring oxidative stress
   and using metabolic biomarkers. No turbidity level was significantly
   lethal to S. marmorata larvae. Moreover, there were no significant
   differences in antioxidant response or oxidative damage between the
   control and turbid water treatments at a low temperature (10 degrees C).
   However, at a high temperature (25 degrees C), turbid water modulated
   the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and
   catalase and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity as an indicator of
   the redox state of the insect larvae. Antioxidant defenses require
   energy, and high temperature was associated with low energy reserves,
   which might limit the capability of organisms to counteract reactive
   oxygen species. Moreover, co-exposure to turbid water and high
   temperature caused fluctuation of antioxidant defenses and increased the
   oxidative damage caused by the production of reactive oxygen species.
   Furthermore, the combined effect of high temperature and turbid water on
   antioxidant defenses and oxidative damage was larger than the individual
   effects. Therefore, our results demonstrate that exposure to both turbid
   water and high temperature generates additive and synergistic
   interactions causing oxidative stress in this aquatic insect species.

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Because many of the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine
   life may result from underlying energetic short-falls associated with
   increased metabolic demands, several studies have hypothesized that
   negative responses to high CO2 could be reduced by energy input.
   Although this hypothesis was supported by a recent meta-analysis, we
   believe that the meta-analytic calculation used was not appropriate to
   test the stated hypothesis. Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put
   forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and
   CO2 interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining
   the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using
   factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive
   effect and CO2 has a negative effect on both growth and calcification.
   For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO2 impacts.
   Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated
   the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope
   upon which CO2 effects can act in food-replete situations. These
   interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic
   approach. Ongoing changes in food supply and carbonate chemistry,
   coupled with under-described, poorly understood, and potentially
   surprising interactive outcomes for these two variables, suggest that
   the role of food should remain a priority in ocean acidification

Abstract = {{Plant defenses often mediate whether competing chewing and sucking
   herbivores indirectly benefit or harm one another. Dual-guild herbivory
   also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to
   locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivore-herbivore
   interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore
   communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes
   are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely
   evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and
   experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that
   chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders
   on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52
   working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on
   broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and
   caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at
   farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up
   experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at
   four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a
   30\% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae),
   and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites.
   Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly
   suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable
   ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism:
   herbivore-herbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This
   work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override
   constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field
   environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated
   interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Competition of two species for the same resource is expected to result
   in competitive exclusion of the inferior competitor. In natural
   communities, however, other antagonists and symbionts moderate
   competition. Thus, we have to go beyond studying pairwise interactions.
   Natural enemies may facilitate coexistence if they affect the superior
   competitor more strongly, or they can hinder coexistence via apparent
   competition. Less well studied is the role of symbionts, which may
   influence species coexistence in conjunction with enemies.
   Eukaryotes commonly harbour microbial endosymbionts that provide
   protection against natural enemies, but are costly in their absence.
   Such defensive symbionts could thus mediate coexistence of species
   competing for the same resource, both in the presence and in the absence
   of enemies, but as yet there is little evidence for this claim.
   We addressed this proposed role of defensive symbionts in replicated
   simple communities consisting of two aphid species sharing the same host
   plant and the same natural enemy, a parasitoid wasp. Both, one, or
   neither species were infected with a resistance-conferring symbiont, and
   they competed in the absence as well as the presence of parasitoids.
   The symbiont had significant effects in the absence of parasitoids by
   lowering competitive ability especially in one species, but the effects
   were more dramatic in the presence of parasitoids. With both species
   protected by the symbiont, parasitoid densities remained low and both
   aphid species persisted. When neither species was protected, parasitoids
   drove both species to extinction. Surprisingly, the same outcome was
   observed when only one species was protected. The susceptible species
   supported high densities of parasitoids that also killed the resistant
   aphids via mechanisms other than parasitism, presumably by disturbing
   them to the point of starvation. This is an intriguing form of apparent
   competition.
   Our results demonstrate an important role of defensive symbionts in
   insect communities through modifying species interactions. This
   highlights the need for experimental data when studying species
   coexistence in competitive networks. Furthermore, the observation that a
   susceptible host can negatively affect a resistant host via a shared
   parasitoid is an instructive insight for biological control.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of competition and predation in structuring ecological
   communities is typically examined separately such that interactions
   between these processes are seldom understood. By causing large
   reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species
   interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas
   to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish
   (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and
   blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively).
   Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical
   effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions
   under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered.
   Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets,
   I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs,
   and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges
   within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control
   populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and
   reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the
   change in biomass and feeding position of 2-5cm size classes of each
   basslet species and calculated the growth rates of similar to 2cm
   individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental
   populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to
   quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video
   playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless
   of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially
   reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2cm) fairy basslet. Predation
   reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap
   basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward
   coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were
   comparable to the response of these fish in populations where
   competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine
   predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via
   differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between
   native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on
   juveniles. This study reveals a newly demonstrated context in which
   predation can indirectly facilitate prey, further broadening our
   understanding of the interactive effects of predation and competition in
   the context of invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{Competing species and predators can alter the habitat use of animals,

   competing species or simultaneously competition and predation risk. The
   species responded differently in their proportional use of two habitat
   types, a low cover (productive but riskier) and a high cover (safer but
   poorer). When alone, field voles used the low-cover habitat according to
   availability at low densities, but decreased its use with increasing
   density. Sibling voles, however, avoided the low-cover habitat in
   single-species populations. Under interspecific competition, the
   habitat-use patterns switched between species: sibling voles used the
   low-cover habitat according to availability, with decreasing use as
   densities increased. Sibling voles responded to predation risk by
   showing a stronger density-dependent decrease in the use of low-cover
   habitat. Field voles, initially using mostly high cover, did not change

Abstract = {{Ecologists have extensively investigated the effect of warming on

   can strengthen, weaken or have no net effect on top-down control of
   resources. These experiments have inspired a body of theoretical work to
   explain the variation in the effect of warming on top-down control.
   However, there has been no quantitative attempt to reconcile theory with
   outcomes from empirical studies. To address the gap between theory and
   experiment, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the combined effect
   of experimental warming and top-down control on resource biomass and
   determined potential sources of variation across experiments. We show
   that differences in experimental outcomes are related to systematic
   variation in the geographical distribution of studies. Specifically,
   warming strengthened top-down control when experiments were conducted in
   colder regions, but had the opposite effect in warmer regions.
   Furthermore, we found that differences in the thermoregulation strategy
   of the consumer and openness of experimental arenas to dispersal can
   contribute to some deviation from the overall geographical pattern.
   These results reconcile empirical findings and support the expectation

Abstract = {{For decades, ecologists have debated the importance of biotic
   interactions (e.g., competition) and abiotic factors in regulating
   populations. Competition can influence patterns of distribution,
   abundance, and resource use in many systems but remains difficult to
   measure. We quantified competition between two sympatric small mammals,
   Keen's mice (Peromyscus keen) and dusky shrews (Sorex monticolus), in
   four habitat types on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. We
   related shrew density to that of mice using standardized regression
   models while accounting for habitat variables in each year from
   2010-2012, during which mice populations peaked (2011) and then crashed
   (2012). Additionally, we measured dietary overlap and segregation using
   stable isotope analysis and kernel utilization densities and estimated
   the change in whole community energy consumption among years. We
   observed an increase in densities of dusky shrews after mice populations
   crashed in 2012 as expected under competitive release. In addition,
   competition coefficients revealed that the influence of Keen's mice was
   dependent on their density. Also in 2012, shrew diets shifted,
   indicating that they were able to exploit resources previously used by
   mice. Nonetheless, increases in shrew numbers only partially compensated
   for the community energy consumption because, as insectivores, they are
   unlikely to utilize all food types consumed by their competitors. In
   pre-commercially thinned stands, which exhibit higher diversity of
   resources compared to other habitat types, shrew populations were less
   affected by changes in mice densities. These spatially and temporally
   variable interactions between unlikely competitors, observed in a
   relatively simple, high-latitude island ecosystem, highlight the
   difficulty in assessing the role of biotic factors in structuring
   communities.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{517-525}},

Abstract = {{Ecological stressors (i.e., environmental factors outside their normal
   range of variation) can mediate each other through their interactions,
   leading to unexpected combined effects on communities. Determining
   whether the net effect of stressors is ecologically surprising requires
   comparing their cumulative impact to a null model that represents the
   linear combination of their individual effects (i.e., an additive
   expectation). However, we show that standard additive and multiplicative
   null models that base their predictions on the effects of single
   stressors on community properties (e.g., species richness or biomass) do
   not provide this linear expectation, leading to incorrect
   interpretations of antagonistic and synergistic responses by
   communities. We present an alternative, the compositional null model,
   which instead bases its predictions on the effects of stressors on
   individual species, and then aggregates them to the community level.
   Simulations demonstrate the improved ability of the compositional null
   model to accurately provide a linear expectation of the net effect of
   stressors. We simulate the response of communities to paired stressors
   that affect species in a purely additive fashion and compare the
   relative abilities of the compositional null model and two standard
   community property null models (additive and multiplicative) to predict
   these linear changes in species richness and community biomass across
   different combinations (both positive, negative, or opposite) and
   intensities of stressors. The compositional model predicts the linear
   effects of multiple stressors under almost all scenarios, allowing for
   proper classification of net effects, whereas the standard null models
   do not. Our findings suggest that current estimates of the prevalence of
   ecological surprises on communities based on community property null
   models are unreliable, and should be improved by integrating the
   responses of individual species to the community level as does our
   compositional null model.}},

   life history traits of the poeciliid live-bearing fish Phalloceros
   harpagos from a tropical stream in Brazil. Females' length at maturity,

   significantly among predation sites. Phalloceros harpagos from the
   high-predation site showed smaller size at maturity and somatic dry
   mass, greater reproductive allotment and higher fecundity than the
   nonpredation site. In all sites, we observed superfetation: pregnant
   females with two broods at different developmental stages. The presence
   of superfetation was not observed before in other congeneric species,
   and it may represent an additional independent evolutionary origin of
   superfetation in the fish family Poeciliidae. Matrotrophy, the
   postfertilisation maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing
   embryos throughout gestation, was observed in all three sites, with
   values of the matrotrophy index above two. The population under high
   predation pressure showed the highest degree of matrotrophy (embryos
   quadruplicate their dry mass during development) and the greatest
   percentage of females with superfetation (44.4\%). Some life history
   traits responded more strongly to predators' presence and others to
   predator density. These results suggest that different predation regimes
   shape female life history traits, increasing fecundity in high-predation
   sites. The results also suggest a link between the cost of reproduction
   and the evolution of matrotrophy and superfetation, potentially to
   reduce the risk of predation without reducing fecundity.}},

Abstract = {{While individual growth ultimately reflects the quality and quantity of

   transitions between habitat types resulting in large pulses of
   individuals into a given location over a short period, which may have
   significant impact on demand for local resources. We evaluated the
   spatial and temporal variation in IGF-1 concentrations (a proxy for
   growth rate) and the relationship between size and concentration for
   juvenile Chinook salmon in Puget Sound, WA, USA, as a function of the
   relative size and abundance of both Chinook salmon and Pacific herring,
   a species which commonly co-occurs with salmonids in nearshore marine
   habitats. The abundance of Chinook salmon and Pacific herring varied
   substantially among the sub-basins as function of outmigration timing
   and spawn timing, respectively, while size varied systematically and
   consistently for both species. Mean IGF-1 concentrations were different
   among sub-basins, although patterns were not consistent through time. In
   general, size was positively correlated with IGF-1 concentration,
   although the slope of the relationship was considerably higher where
   Pacific herring were more abundant than Chinook salmon; specifically
   where smaller individual herring, relative to Chinook salmon, were more
   abundant. Where Pacific herring were less abundant than Chinook salmon,
   IGF-1 concentrations among small and large Chinook salmon were more
   variable and showed no consistent increase for larger individuals. The
   noticeable positive effect of relative Pacific herring abundance on the
   relationship between size and individual growth rates likely represents
   a shift to predation based on increased IGF-1 concentrations for
   individual Chinook salmon that are large enough to incorporate fish into
   their diet and co-occur with the highest abundances of Pacific herring.}},

Abstract = {{The strength and importance of consumer effects are predicted to

   the magnitude of consumer effects on these metrics did not display
   consistent latitudinal gradients. Instead, latitudinal gradients in

   Solitary ascidians displayed the pattern consistent with predictions of

   consumers reduced the biomass of this and other competitive dominants,

Abstract = {{Aim: Understanding the relative contribution of different species
   interactions in shaping community assembly has been a pivotal aim in
   community ecology. Biotic interactions are acknowledged to be important
   at local scales, although their signal is assumed to weaken over longer
   distances. We examine the relationship between positive, neutral and
   negative pairwise bird abundance distributions and the phylogenetic and
   functional distance between these pairs after first controlling for
   habitat associations.
   Location: France and Finland.
   Time period: 1984 to 2011 (Finland), 2001 to 2012 (France).
   Major Taxa studied: Birds.
   Methods: We used results from French and Finnish land bird monitoring
   programmes, from which we created three independent datasets (French
   forests, French farmlands and Finnish forests). Separately for the three
   datasets, we fitted linear mixed-effects models for pairwise abundance
   values across years per point count station to infer the association
   between all common species pairs, while controlling for geographical
   distribution and habitat associations, and saved pairwise regression
   coefficients for further analyses. We used a null model approach to
   infer whether the observed associations (effect sizes) differ from
   random. Finally, using quantile regression, we analysed the
   relationships between functional dissimilarity/phylogenetic distance and
   effect sizes.
   Results: Our results show both negative and positive species
   interactions, although negative interactions were twice as common as

Abstract = {{1. Determining how changes in abiotic conditions influence community
   interactions is a fundamental challenge in ecology. Meeting this
   challenge is increasingly imperative in the Anthropocene where climate
   change and exotic species introductions alter abiotic context and biotic
   composition to reshuffle natural systems.
   2. We created plant assemblages consisting of monocultures or equal
   abundance of the native community dominant bluebunch wheatgrass
   (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and the exotic spotted knapweed (Centaurea
   stoebe), a co-occurring invasive forb that has overtaken grasslands
   across the western United States. We subjected these composition
   treatments to drought (20\% of average precipitation vs. average) and
   herbivory on C. stoebe by its biocontrol agent Cyphocleonus achates to
   explore how reduced precipitation might influence the effects of
   competition and biocontrol herbivory on C. stoebe's abundance.
   3. At the end of 7 years, C. stoebe dominated mixed-species plots under
   normal precipitation conditions, with biomass 50\% greater than that of
   the native P. spicata. However, under drought stress, P. spicata's
   biomass was >200\% greater than C. stoebe's. Interestingly, both species
   were impervious to drought in monoculture, indicating the importance of
   the drought by competition interaction. The biocontrol herbivore reduced
   C. stoebe abundance and indirectly increased P. spicata biomass in
   mixed-species drought plots, but these effects were only marginally
   significant and relatively weak. Overall, C. stoebe abundance was
   primarily driven by the drought by competition interaction, with
   negatively additive but weak effects of the drought by herbivory
   interaction.
   4. The response of the exotic to the treatments was driven by rapid
   changes in population density linked to its fast life-history strategy,
   while the native's response was driven by changes in per capita plant
   biomass linked to its slower life-history strategy. Individual plant
   performance metrics did not predict overall population responses for the
   invader, indicating the importance of longer term population measures.
   5. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that reduced precipitation
   inputs linked to climate change can dramatically shift the balance of
   plant competition, even toggling the advantage from exotic to native
   dominance. They also illustrate the importance of biotic interactions in
   predicting species responses to abiotic change.}},

Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{661-673}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Competition and herbivory are ubiquitous processes known to
   interactively shape plant performance, distribution and community
   assembly. Likewise, plant genetic variation and associated trait
   differences can impact both plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions
   individually, yet few studies have explored these interactions
   simultaneously.
   2. Saltmarsh communities are an ideal system to study these questions,
   as they are dominated along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United
   States by a foundation plant species, Spartina alterniflora, with high
   levels of genetically based trait variation. Furthermore, consumer
   pressure and plant competitors are known to influence both the
   distribution and production of Spartina. We manipulated Spartina genetic
   identity, neighbour identity (needlerush, Juncus roemerianus) and
   consumer presence (snail, Littoraria irrorata) in a 1-year field
   experiment in St. Joseph Bay, FL, to test how the strength and direction
   of neighbour and consumer interactions vary by plant genotype.
   3. Consumer effects on Spartina were generally stronger and more
   variable than those of the plant neighbourhood, and these effects were
   generally consistent across Spartina genotypes. However,
   genotype-specific variation in morphology, phenology and palatability
   significantly influenced both consumer and neighbour responses to
   Spartina: the consumer Littoraria was more likely to climb palatable
   Spartina genotypes, and neighbouring Juncus had shorter stems in the
   presence of highly productive Spartina genotypes.
   4. Synthesis. Our results add to the growing list of examples
   high-lighting the role of intraspecific variation in species
   interactions and suggest that variation in these interactions may
   promote the maintenance of plant genetic variation and community

Abstract = {{Nurse plant facilitation in stressful environments can produce an
   environment with relatively low stress under its canopy. These nurse
   plants may produce the conditions promoting intense competition between
   coexisting species under the canopy, and canopies may establish stress
   gradients, where stress increases toward the edge of the canopy.
   Competition and facilitation on these stress gradients may control
   species distributions in the communities under canopies. We tested the
   following predictions: (1) interactions between understory species shift
   from competition to facilitation in habitats experiencing increasing
   stress from the center to the edge of canopy of a nurse plant, and (2)
   species distributions in understory communities are controlled by
   competitive interactions at the center of canopy, and facilitation at
   the edge of the canopy. We tested these predictions using a neighbor
   removal experiment under nurse trees growing in arid environments.
   Established individuals of each of four of the most common herbaceous
   species in the understory were used in the experiment. Two species were
   more frequent in the center of the canopy, and two species were more
   frequent at the edge of the canopy. Established individuals of each
   species were subjected to neighbor removal or control treatments in both
   canopy center and edge habitats. We found a shift from competitive to
   facilitative interactions from the center to the edge of the canopy. The
   shift in the effect of neighbors on the target species can help to
   explain species distributions in these canopies. Canopy-dominant species
   only perform well in the presence of neighbors in the edge microhabitat.
   Competition from canopy-dominant species can also limit the performance
   of edge-dominant species in the canopy microhabitat. The shift from
   competition to facilitation under nurse plant canopies can structure the
   understory communities in extremely stressful environments.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming can destabilize interactions between competitors as

   assembled a litter arthropod community with two Collembola species

   a temperature gradient (three thermal environments) and in the presence

   the larger prey species always outperformed the smaller prey species in
   warmer environments with predators. Larger prey probably benefited as

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of predators is affected by intra- and
   interspecific interactions within the predator guild. Studying these
   interactions under fluctuating food availability, while taking habitat
   characteristics into account, offers a quasi-experimental setup to
   determine the relative impact of con-and heterospecifics on reproductive
   success of predators. We analyzed the settlement decisions and
   reproductive success of Eurasian Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in
   the presence of both breeding conspecifics and their competitor and
   intraguild predator, Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus), under
   fluctuating abundance of their primary prey (voles). We used detailed
   data, collected across 11 years in a large study area (1300 km(2)), on
   the spatial and temporal variation of habitat characteristics in all
   available nesting sites, local densities of both species, and vole
   abundance. We found that Pygmy Owls strongly avoided breeding close to
   conspecifics but did not avoid Tengmalm's Owl nests. Nest box occupation
   of Pygmy Owls was positively correlated to the proportion of old spruce,
   mature and old pine forests, and farmlands, and occupation probability
   was higher at high vole abundance and in areas occupied in previous
   years. Pygmy Owl avoidance of conspecifics decreased when voles were
   abundant. At high conspecific density, Pygmy Owls showed lower hatching
   success and delayed hatching date, in agreement with the observed
   spatial avoidance. Finally, even though breeding Pygmy Owls did not
   spatially avoid Tengmalm's Owls, the density of heterospecifics
   correlated with low hatching and fledging success in Pygmy Owls. This
   suggests short term fitness costs when living close to competitors, even
   when lethal effects of intraguild interactions are subtle. Our results
   suggest that joint costs of exploitative and interference competition by
   Tengmalm's Owls, as well as intraguild predation, were lower than those
   induced by intraspecific competition only. This result might be due to
   the similar body size between the species considered, Tengmalm's Owls
   being only twice as large as Pygmy Owls. Interactions among con-and
   heterospecifics can therefore modify the spatial settlement and
   reproductive success of individuals on a landscape scale, also within

Volume = {{301}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-164}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly assumed that prey must make growth-defense trade-offs
   when in the presence of predators under resource-limited conditions.
   Thus, it is predicted that prey will allocate limited resources either
   to competitive phenotypes to grow or to defensive phenotypes to defend,
   but not both. Evidence from plants, however, has suggested that under
   strong selection prey might evolve phenotypes that allow them to
   simultaneously compete and defend. In a controlled laboratory
   experiment, we investigated phenotypic investment in asymmetrically
   competing tadpoles of Rhacophorus schlegelii (RS) and Pelophylax
   nigromaculatus (PN) in the presence and absence of predatory dragonfly
   larvae. We predicted that, because of differences in resource
   acquisition abilities, tadpoles would invest in competitive and
   defensive phenotypes differently, depending on their relative
   competitive ability in the presence of predators. RS was the superior
   competitor and depressed the growth of PN whether predators were present
   or absent. As expected, the inferior competitor (PN) responded to
   competition by elongating its gut in predator-free environments. In
   contrast, the superior competitor (RS) did not respond to competition.
   In the presence of predators, both tadpoles invested in larger tails, a
   common defensive trait, while the presence of competitors did not
   influence tail size. When reared alone in the presence of predators, PN
   grew faster and tended to have a longer gut. In contrast to theoretical
   predictions, however, in the presence of both predators and competitors
   the inferior competitor (PN) still maintained the competitive (long gut)
   and defensive (large tail) phenotypes despite being depressed in growth.
   Optimal digestion theory suggests that gut elongation should enhance
   assimilation efficiency and energy gain. In this view, when a
   competitive phenotype also serves to benefit prey in predator
   environments, prey may be able to both compete and defend.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of environmental change on natural ecosystems
   is a major challenge, particularly when multiple stressors interact to

   Animals often respond behaviorally to environmental change, and multiple
   stressors can have both population-level and community-level effects.
   However, the individual, not combined, effects of stressors on animal
   behavior are commonly studied. There is a need to understand how animals
   respond to the more complex combinations of stressors that occur in
   nature, which requires a systematic and rigorous approach to quantify
   the various potential behavioral responses to the independent and
   interactive effects of stressors. We illustrate a robust, systematic
   approach for understanding behavioral responses to multiple stressors
   based on integrating schemes used to quantitatively classify
   interactions in multiple-stressor research and to qualitatively view
   interactions between multiple stimuli in behavioral experiments. We
   introduce and unify the two frameworks, highlighting their conceptual
   and methodological similarities, and use four case studies to
   demonstrate how this unification could improve our interpretation of
   interactions in behavioral experiments and guide efforts to manage the
   effects of multiple stressors. Our unified approach: (1) provides
   behavioral ecologists with a more rigorous and systematic way to
   quantify how animals respond to interactions between multiple stimuli,
   an important theoretical advance, (2) helps us better understand how
   animals behave when they encounter multiple, potentially interacting

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{136-146}},

Abstract = {{1. Identification of the mechanisms enabling stable coexistence of
   species with similar resource requirements is a central challenge in
   ecology. Such coexistence can be facilitated by species at higher
   trophic levels through complex multi-trophic interactions, a mechanism
   that could be compromised by ongoing defaunation.
   2. We investigated cascading effects of defaunation on Pachymerus cardo
   and Speciomerus giganteus, the specialized insect seed predators of the
   Neotropical palm Attalea butyracea, testing the hypothesis that
   vertebrate frugivores and granivores facilitate their coexistence.
   3. Laboratory experiments showed that the two seed parasitoid species
   differed strongly in their reproductive ecology. Pachymerus produced
   many small eggs that it deposited exclusively on the fruit exocarp
   (exterior). Speciomerus produced few large eggs that it deposited
   exclusively on the endocarp, which is normally exposed only after a
   vertebrate handles the fruit. When eggs of the two species were
   deposited on the same fruit, Pachymerus triumphed only when it had a
   long head start, and the loser always succumbed to intraguild predation.
   4. We collected field data on the fates of 6569 Attalea seeds across
   sites in central Panama with contrasting degrees of defaunation and wide
   variation in the abundance of vertebrate frugivores and granivores.
   Speciomerus dominated where vertebrate communities were intact, whereas
   Pachymerus dominated in defaunated sites. Variation in the relative
   abundance of Speciomerus across all 84 sampling sites was strongly
   positively related to the proportion of seeds attacked by rodents, an
   indicator of local vertebrate abundance.
   5. Synthesis. We show that two species of insect seed predators relying
   on the same host plant species are niche differentiated in their
   reproductive strategies such that one species has the advantage when
   fruits are handled promptly by vertebrates and the other when they are
   not. Defaunation disrupts this mediating influence of vertebrates and
   strongly favours one species at the expense of the other, providing a
   case study of the cascading effects of defaunation and its potential to
   disrupt coexistence of non-target species, including the hyperdiverse
   phytophagous insects of tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, prey are often simultaneously exposed to predators and
   competitors, leading to conflicting demands between survival and growth.
   Larval amphibians are model organisms to investigate the balancing of
   life history trade-offs because individuals must metamorphose before a
   wetland dries. Therefore, we deployed enclosures in a natural wetland to
   investigate the interactive effects of Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica)
   density (50 or 100 tadpoles) and Brook Stickleback (Culaea inconstans)
   presence on survival and growth of tadpoles. We hypothesized that the
   effects of conspecific density on tadpole survival and growth would be
   dependent on the presence of fish predators. Stickleback predation
   significantly decreased Wood Frog survival; however, a trend of higher
   tadpole survival with fish was detected at high conspecific densities.
   Wood Frog time to and mass at metamorphosis was not significantly
   affected by either conspecific density or stickleback presence. Our
   results demonstrate that Brook Sticklebacks can play a significant role
   in regulating Wood Frog survival in a Subarctic wetland, but the impact
   is likely dependent on tadpole density. Therefore, this research
   highlights the dynamic and complex effects of competition and predation

Abstract = {{Rapid, global, anthropogenic alteration of food webs in ecosystems
   necessitates a better understanding of how consumers regulate natural
   communities. We provide a global synthesis of consumer control of
   vegetation in coastal wetlands, where the domineering role of physical
   factors such as nutrient and salinity, rather than consumers, has been
   emphasized for decades. Using a data set of 1748 measures of consumer
   effects reported in 443 experiments/observations on all continents
   except Antarctica, we examine the generality of consumer control in salt
   marshes and mangroves globally. Our analyses show that salt marsh
   herbivores, including insects, snails, crabs, waterfowl, small mammals,
   and livestock, generally and often strongly suppress plant survival,
   aboveground biomass, and height, while their effects on plant density,
   belowground biomass, reproduction, and cover are more variable. These
   effects occur in forbs, grasses, and shrubs, and in both seedlings and
   adult plants. Herbivores additionally affect plant nutrient
   stoichiometry, and mediate plant interactions, though their effects on
   plant diversity are less consistent. Higher trophic levels also affect
   plants, as predators facilitate plant growth through trophic cascades
   that suppress grazer abundance and grazing rate. In mangroves, there are
   also signs of consumer control, though the relatively few studies
   available have often focused on mangrove propagules and seedlings rather
   than adults. Our analyses further reveal that the strength of consumer
   control is regulated by many physical factors. Nutrient, disturbance,
   and flooding, for example, amplify the negative effects of herbivores.
   Along latitudinal gradients, increased temperature enhances the negative
   effects of ectothermic herbivores, but has no effect on those of
   endothermic herbivores. Consumer control of coastal plants is also
   apparent across study methodologies: in field and laboratory settings,
   in observational studies, in consumer exclusion and addition
   experiments, in natural and transplanted plants, and in experiments of
   various durations. The role of consumer control in coastal vegetation
   worldwide highlights the need to better recognize and theoretically
   conceptualize both top-down and bottom-up forcing and their interactions
   in coastal wetlands. Improved understanding and conservation of coastal
   wetlands will only occur if we incorporate what the-science has
   revealed: trophic feedbacks are an important and pervasive determinant

   aggregative literature review, aggregative meta-analysis, and
   aggregative systematic review. We found that most literature reviews did
   not adequately explain the methodology used to find the literature under

Abstract = {{The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is more vulnerable and sensitive to
   climate change than many other regions worldwide because of its high
   altitude, permafrost geography, and harsh physical environment. As a
   sensitive bio-indicator of climate change, plant phenology shift in this
   region has been intensively studied during the recent decades, primarily
   based on satellite-retrieved data. However, great controversy still
   exists regarding the change in direction and magnitudes of spring-summer
   phenology. Based on a large number (11,000+ records) of long-term and
   continuous ground observational data for various plant species, our
   study intended to more comprehensively assess the changing trends of
   spring-summer phenology and their relationships with climatic change
   across the QTP. The results indicated a continuous advancement (-2.69
   days decade(-1)) in spring-summer phenology from 1981 to 2011, with an
   even more rapid advancement during 2000-2011 (-3.13 days decade-1),
   which provided new field evidence for continuous advancement in
   spring-summer phenology across the QTP. However, diverse advancing rates
   in spring-summer phenology were observed for different vegetation types,
   thermal conditions, and seasons. The advancing trends matched well with
   the difference in sensitivity of spring-summer phenology to increasing
   temperature, implying that the sensitivity of phenology to temperature
   was one of the major factors influencing spring-summer phenology shifts.
   Besides, increased precipitation could advance the spring-summer
   phenology. The response of spring-summer phenology to temperature tended
   to be stronger from east to west across all species, while the response
   to precipitation showed no consistent spatial pattern. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It is often argued that ecological communities admit of no useful
   generalizations or ``laws{''} because these systems are especially prone
   to contingent historical events. Detractors respond that this argument
   assumes an overly stringent definition of laws of nature. Under a more
   relaxed conception, it is argued that ecological laws emerge at the
   level of communities and elsewhere. A brief review of this debate
   reveals an issue with deep philosophical roots that is unlikely to be
   resolved by a better understanding of generalizations in ecology. We
   therefore propose a strategy for transforming the conceptual question
   about the nature of ecological laws into a set of empirically tractable
   hypotheses about the relative resilience of ecological generalizations
   across three dimensions: taxonomy, habitat type, and scale. These
   hypotheses are tested using a survey of 240 meta-analyses in ecology.
   Our central finding is that generalizations in community ecology are
   just as prevalent and as resilient as those in population or ecosystem
   ecology. These findings should help to establish community ecology as a
   generality-seeking science as opposed to a science of case studies. It
   also supports the capacity for ecologists, working at any of the three
   levels, to inform matters of public policy.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Intraguild (IG) predation and interspecific competition may affect the
   settlement and success of species in their habitats. Using data on
   forest-dwelling hawks from Finland, we addressed the impact of an IG
   predator, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis (goshawk), on the
   breeding of an IG prey, the common buzzard Buteo buteo. We hypothesized
   that the subordinate common buzzard avoids breeding in the proximity of
   goshawks and that interspecific competitors, mainly Strix owls, may also
   disturb common buzzards by competing for nests and food. Our results
   show that common buzzards more frequently occupied territories with a
   low IG predation threat and with no interspecific competitors. We also
   observed that common buzzards avoided territories with high levels of
   grouse, the main food of goshawks, possibly due to a risk of IG
   predation since abundant grouse can attract goshawks. High levels of
   small rodents attracted interspecific competitors to common buzzard
   territories and created a situation where there was not only an
   abundance of food but also an abundance of competitors for the food.
   These results suggest interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes
   which influence the interactions between avian predator species. We
   conclude that the common buzzard needs to balance the risks of IG
   predation and interference competition with the availability of its own
   resources. The presence of other predators associated with high food
   levels may impede a subordinate predator taking full advantage of the
   available food. Based on our results, it appears that interspecific
   interactions with dominant predators have the potential to influence the
   distribution pattern of subordinate predators.}},

Abstract = {{Predation and competition are critical processes influencing the ecology
   of organisms, and can play an integral role in shaping coral reef fish
   communities. This study compared the relative and interacting effects of
   competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish,
   Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a
   multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of
   a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the
   heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or
   a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects
   of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a
   combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were
   used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted
   that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong
   sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural
   patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only
   for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator
   and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when
   subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was
   strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish
   species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying
   strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions
   for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come
   about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which
   significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with
   controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor
   synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for
   juvenile coral reef fishes.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection's role in speciation has been of fundamental
   importance since Darwin first outlined his theory. Recently, work has
   focused on understanding how selection drives trait divergence, and
   subsequently reproductive isolation. ``Immigrant inviability,{''} a
   barrier that arises from selection against immigrants in their nonnative
   environment, appears to be of particular importance. Although immigrant
   inviability is likely ubiquitous, we know relatively little about how
   selection acts on traits to drive immigrant inviability, and how
   important immigrant inviability is at early-versus-late stages of
   divergence. We present a study evaluating the role of predation in the
   evolution of immigrant inviability in recently diverged population pairs
   and a well-established species pair of Brachyrhaphis fishes. We evaluate
   performance in a high-predation environment by assessing survival in the
   presence of a predator, and swimming endurance in a low-predation
   environment. We find strong signatures of local adaptation and immigrant
   inviability of roughly the same magnitude both early and late in
   divergence. We find remarkably conserved selection for burst-speed
   swimming (important in predator evasion), and selection for increased
   size in low-predation environments. Our results highlight the
   consistency with which selection acts during speciation, and suggest
   that similar factors might promote initial population differentiation
   and maintain differentiation at late stages of divergence.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in predation risk plays an important role in shaping prey
   behavior, morphology, life history, population dynamics, and community
   structure in freshwater systems. Anuran larvae are important prey in
   freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise
   from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our
   understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates
   for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is
   limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to
   estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and
   time. We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most
   common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical
   frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless
   Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly
   threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold
   within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers
   (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the
   most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that
   prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some
   presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed
   >90\% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally
   experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate
   predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing
   spiders consumed more A. callidryas. These results suggest that strong
   but variable larval-stage risk may be an important selective factor
   shaping tadpole communities and phenotypes in Neotropical ponds.}},

Abstract = {{While it is well documented that organisms can express phenotypic
   plasticity in response to single gradients of environmental variation,
   our understanding of how organisms integrate information along multiple
   environmental gradients is limited in many systems. Using the freshwater
   snail Helisoma trivolvis and two common predators (water bugs Belostoma
   flumineum and crayfish Orconectes rusticus), we explored how prey
   integrate information along multiple predation risk gradients (i.e.
   caged predators fed increasing amounts of prey biomass) that induce
   opposing phenotypes. When exposed to single predators fed increasing
   amounts of prey biomass, we detected threshold responses; intermediate
   amounts of consumed biomass induced phenotypic responses, but higher
   amounts induced little additional induction. This suggests that
   additional increases in predator-induced traits with greater predator
   risk offer minimal increases in fitness or that a limit in the response
   magnitude was reached. Additionally, the response thresholds were
   contingent on the predator and focal trait. For shell width, responses
   were generally detected at a lower amount of consumed biomass by water
   bugs compared to crayfish. Within the crayfish treatments, we found that
   the shell thickness response threshold was lower than the shell width
   response threshold. When we combined gradients of consumed biomass from
   both predators, we found that the magnitude of response to one predator
   was often reduced when the other predator was present. Interestingly,
   these effects were often detected at consumed biomass levels that were
   lower than the threshold concentration necessary to elicit a response in
   the single-predator treatments. Moreover, our combined predator
   treatments revealed that snails shifted from discrete responses to more
   continuous (i.e. graded) responses. Together, our results reveal that
   organisms experiencing multiple environmental gradients can integrate
   this information to make phenotypic decisions and demonstrate the novel
   result that an exposure to multiple species of predators can lower the
   response threshold of prey.}},

Abstract = {{The accelerating rate of global change has focused attention on the
   cumulative impacts of novel and extreme environmental changes (i.e.
   stressors), especially in marine ecosystems. As integrators of local
   catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked
   highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has
   not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88
   papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired
   stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size
   was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic
   interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional
   performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic,
   respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method
   revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more
   antagonistic (41\%) than synergistic (28\%), additive (16\%) or reversed
   (15\%). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of
   two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from
   that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with
   nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net
   effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most
   importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response
   metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the
   greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a
   possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota
   to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of
   smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and
   co-adaptation to multiple stressors.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that global warming will adversely affect
   ecological communities. As ecosystems are simultaneously exposed to
   other anthropogenic influences, it is important to address the effects
   of climate change in the context of many stressors. Nutrient enrichment
   might offset some of the energy demands that warming can exert on
   organisms by stimulating growth at the base of the food web. It is
   important to know whether indirect effects of warming will be as
   ecologically significant as direct physiological effects. Declining body
   size is increasingly viewed as a universal response to warming, with the
   potential to alter trophic interactions. To address these issues, we
   used an outdoor array of marine mesocosms to examine the impacts of
   warming, nutrient enrichment and altered top-predator body size on a
   community comprised of the predator (shore crab Carcinus maenas),
   various grazing detritivores (amphipods) and algal resources. Warming
   increased mortality rates of crabs, but had no effect on their moulting
   rates. Nutrient enrichment and warming had near diametrically opposed
   effects on the assemblage, confirming that the ecological effects of
   these two stressors can cancel each other out. This suggests that
   nutrient-enriched systems might act as an energy refuge to populations
   of species under metabolic constraints due to warming. While there was a
   strong difference in assemblages between mesocosms containing crabs
   compared to mesocosms without crabs, decreasing crab size had no
   detectable effect on the amphipod or algal assemblages. This suggests
   that in allometrically balanced communities, the expected long-term
   effect of warming (declining body size) is not of similar ecological
   consequence to the direct physiological effects of warming, at least not
   over the six week duration of the experiment described here. More
   research is needed to determine the long-term effects of declining body
   size on the bioenergetic balance of natural communities.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to understand the ecological regulation of species diversity via
   bottom-up approaches have failed to yield a consensus theory. Theories
   based on the alternative of top-down regulation have fared better.
   Paine's discovery of keystone predation demonstrated that the regulation
   of diversity via top-down forcing could be simple, strong, and direct,
   yet ecologists have persistently failed to perceive generality in
   Paine's result. Removing top predators destabilizes many systems and
   drives transitions to radically distinct alternative states. These
   transitions typically involve community reorganization and loss of
   diversity, implying that top-down forcing is crucial to diversity
   maintenance. Contrary to the expectations of bottom-up theories, many
   terrestrial herbivores and mesopredators are capable of sustained
   order-of-magnitude population increases following release from
   predation, negating the assumption that populations of primary consumers
   are resource limited and at or near carrying capacity. Predation sensu
   lato (to include Janzen-Connell mortality agents) has been shown to
   promote diversity in a wide range of ecosystems, including rocky
   intertidal shelves, coral reefs, the nearshore ocean, streams, lakes,
   temperate and tropical forests, and arctic tundra. The compelling
   variety of these ecosystems suggests that top-down forcing plays a
   universal role in regulating diversity. This conclusion is further
   supported by studies showing that the reduction or absence of predation
   leads to diversity loss and, in the more dramatic cases, to catastrophic
   regime change. Here, I expand on the thesis that diversity is maintained
   by the interaction between predation and competition, such that strong
   top-down forcing reduces competition, allowing coexistence.}},

Abstract = {{Leopards (Panthera pardus) are the most widely distributed wild felid in
   the world, living sympatrically with numerous competitively dominant
   species in various large carnivore guilds. Leopards generally feed on
   small to medium-sized ungulates and risk klepto-parasitism from
   intraguild competitors. One unique, adaptive response to intraguild
   competition is arboreal caching ('hoisting') by leopards. Hoisting
   behaviour is thought to vary in frequency among individuals,
   populations, and between sexes. In our study, leopards fed primarily
   (85\% of observed kills) on impala (Aepyceros melampus), which is the
   most locally abundant potential prey species. Although we did not detect
   statistical differences in hoisting rates among individuals within each
   sex, our results confirmed moderate hoisting rates of 35\% in an area
   with medium densities of lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta
   crocuta) and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Sex differences in prey
   hoisting were related to size, and males as the larger sex, hoisted
   kills (47.7\%, n = 44) more often than overlapping females (27\%, n =
   62). Female leopards hoisted 25-33\% of detected kills irrespective of
   prey size, season, habitat type, presence of dependent cubs, or location
   in relation to high competitor density areas ('competitor hotspots').
   Consistent with this, males hoisted kills more often where visibility
   and, therefore, probability of detection was highest. We conclude that
   hoisting is likely correlated with energetic costs, seasonally increased
   detection by competitors, and direct competitor interactions rather than
   the potential risk of conflicts within generalized areas of high
   competitor use ('hotspots').}},

Abstract = {{Many species are expected to shift their geographic distribution as
   climates change, and yet climate change is only one of a suite of
   stressors that species face. Species that might, in theory, be able to
   shift rapidly enough to keep up with climate velocity (the rate and
   direction that isotherms move across the landscape) may not in actuality
   be able to do so when facing the cumulative impacts of multiple
   stressors. Despite empirical reports of substantial interactions between
   climate change and other stressors, we often lack a mechanistic
   understanding of these interactions. Here, we developed and analyzed a
   spatial population dynamics model to explore the cumulative impacts of
   climate with another dominant stressor in the ocean and on land:
   harvest. We found that critical rates of climate velocity and harvest
   depend on the growth rate and dispersal kernel of the population, as
   well as the magnitude of the other stressor. This allowed us to identify
   conditions under which harvesting and climate velocity can together
   drive populations extinct even when neither stressor would do so in
   isolation. Except in these extreme cases, we also found that the
   interaction between the declines in biomass caused by climate velocity
   and harvest is approximately additive. Finally, we have shown that
   threshold harvest rules can be effective management tools to mitigate
   the interaction between the two stressors, while protected areas can
   either help or hinder, depending on how harvesters reallocate their
   effort. We also have parameterized the model for black rockfish
   (Sebastes melanops) to demonstrate the model's broad applicability.}},

Abstract = {{Competition and herbivory are two major factors that can influence plant
   growth and plant defence. Although these two factors arc often studied
   separately, they do not operate independently. We examined how
   aboveground hcrbivory by beet armyworm larvae (Spodoptera exigua) and
   belowground herbivory by wireworms (Agriotes lineatus) influenced
   competition between the plant species Jaeobaea vulgaris and Leucanthemum
   vulgare exposed to three competition levels (no, intra-, and
   interspecific competition), In addition, we studied the effects of
   herbivory and competition on pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) concentrations
   in leaves of J. vulgaris. For J. vulgaris, aboveground herbivory
   significantly reduced shoot biomass while belowground herbivory
   increased root biomass. Biomass of L. vulgore was not affected by
   herbivory. Competition caused a reduction in biomass for both plant
   species, but herbivory did not affect the outcome of the competition.
   However, competition significantly influenced the amount of leaf damage
   experienced by the plants. A L. vulgore plant had significantly less
   damage from aboveground herbivores when grown together with J. vulgaris
   than when grown alone or in intraspecific competition, while a J.
   vulgaris plant experienced lowest damage in conditions of intraspecific
   competition. The total PA concentration in J. vulgaris leaves was
   highest for plants exposed to interspecific competition. Root herbivory
   caused an increase in the relative concentration of N-oxides, he less
   toxic form of PAs, in leaves of plants that were grown without
   competition, but a decrease in plants exposed to competition. Our study
   shows that competition and herbivory but also the type of competition
   and whether herbivory occurs above- or bclowground, all influence plant
   performance. However, overall, there was no evidence that herbivory
   affects plant plant competition.}},

Abstract = {{Predators affect benthic communities and ecological processes through
   consuming and scaring prey as well as through engineering effects on the
   habitat. Experimental evidence of top-down predatory effects in leaf
   packs comes from studies assessing how large predators affect shredders
   and therefore the litter decomposition rate. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of smaller invertebrate predators on micro- and
   meiobenthic communities. In outdoor, flow-through stream channels, we
   created a gradient in the density of predacious Chloroperlidae stonefly
   larvae in enclosures containing alder leaf litter and exposed to natural
   colonisation by invertebrates and decomposers. We expected that: (i)
   predators would reduce the biomass and density of invertebrate
   colonisers, (ii) the strength of predator effects on invertebrates would
   vary with prey body size; and (iii) increasing predator numbers in
   enclosures would diminish the per capita strength of predator-prey
   interactions due to intraguild interference. We also anticipated that
   litter decomposition would be slower in the presence of predators
   providing that microbial decomposers did not compensate for the
   reduction in shredders by an increase in their biomass. Chloroperlidae
   had negative effects on the biomass of most major invertebrate taxa,
   including rotifers, nematodes and larvae of the Chironomidae Corynoneura
   and Brillia (the dominant shredder in leaf packs). The predatory effect
   on nematode biomass was strongest for dominant small-bodied species.
   Fungal biomass in leaf litter was reduced in the presence of predators,
   whereas bacterial biomass was not affected. In addition to feasible
   direct predation on Chironomidae, Chloroperlidae apparently inhibited
   meiofauna colonisation of leaf litter, probably through the bioturbation
   of fine sediment trapped on leaf surfaces. At the end of the experiment,
   the mortality of Chloroperlidae in enclosures was considerable at the
   highest predator density treatment. This observation, along with
   evidence of the reduced per capita strength of predator-prey
   interactions with increasing predator density, suggested that intraguild
   interference moderates the effect of predators in leaf packs. Our
   findings are consistent with a key role of small predators in
   determining the abundance of invertebrates and microbial decomposers in
   leaf packs. However, in our study, there was no cascade down to the
   standing stock of leaf litter.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of co-occurrence of species are increasingly used to examine
   the contribution of biotic interactions to community assembly. We
   assessed patterns of co-occurrence at four scales, in two types of
   tropical cloud forests in Hainan Island, China (tropical montane
   evergreen forests, TMEF and tropical dwarf forests, TDF) that varied
   significantly in soil nutrients and temperature. We tested if the
   patterns of co-occurrence changed when we sorted species into classes by
   abundance and diameter at breast height (dbh). Co-occurrence differed by
   forest type and with plot size, with significant species aggregation
   observed across larger plots in TDF and patterns of species segregation
   observed in smaller plots in TMEF. Analyses of differential abundance
   and dbh classes also showed that smaller plots in TMEF tend to have
   negative co-occurrence patterns, but larger plots in TDF tend to show
   patterns of aggregation, suggesting competitive and facilitative
   interactions. This underscores the scale-dependence of the processes
   contributing to community assembly. Furthermore, it is consistent with
   predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis that facilitation will be
   most important in biological systems subject to abiotic stress, while
   competition will be more important in less abiotically stressful
   habitats. Our results clearly demonstrate that these two types of
   tropical cloud forest exhibit different co-occurrence patterns, and that
   these patterns are scale-dependent, though independent of plant
   abundance and size class.}},

Abstract = {{Selective predation can lead to natural selection in prey populations
   and may alleviate competition among surviving individuals. The processes
   of selection and competition can have substantial effects on prey
   population dynamics, but are rarely studied simultaneously. Moreover,
   field studies of predator-induced short-term selection pressures on prey
   populations are scarce. Here we report measurements of density
   dependence in body composition in a bivalve prey (edible cockle,
   Cerastoderma edule) during bouts of intense predation by an avian
   predator (Red Knot, Calidris canutus). We measured densities,
   patchiness, morphology, and body composition (shell and flesh mass) of
   cockles in a quasi-experimental setting, i.e., before and after
   predation in three similar plots of 1 ha each, two of which experienced
   predation, and one of which remained unvisited in the course of the
   short study period and served as a reference. An individual's shell and
   flesh mass declined with cockle density (negative density dependence).
   Before predation, cockles were patchily distributed. After predation,
   during which densities were reduced by 78\% (from 232 to 50
   cockles/m(2)), the patchiness was substantially reduced, i.e., the
   spatial distribution was homogenized. Red Knots selected juvenile
   cockles with an average length of 6.9 +/- 1.0 mm (mean +/- SD). Cockles
   surviving predation had heavier shells than before predation (an
   increase of 21.5 percentage points), but similar flesh masses. By
   contrast, in the reference plot shell mass did not differ statistically
   between initial and final sampling occasions, while flesh mass was
   larger (an increase of 13.2 percentage points). In this field study, we
   show that Red Knots imposed a strong selection pressure on cockles to
   grow fast with thick shells and little flesh mass, with selection
   gradients among the highest reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of nonnative species and subsequent replacement of
   native species is among the greatest threats to freshwater biodiversity
   worldwide. However, little is known of the effects that invasive species
   have on individual species and specific mechanisms by which species
   displacement occurs. The expansion of western mosquitofish Gambusia
   affinis beyond its native range has commonly been thought to cause
   shifts in species assemblages throughout the United States. Although
   plains topminnow Fundulus sciadicus populations have declined as the
   range of western mosquitofish in Nebraska has expanded, long-term
   co-existence of mosquitofish with the closely related northern plains
   killifish Fundulus kansae has been observed within the same systems. To
   investigate the potential mechanisms by which differential displacement
   of the native topminnow species may have occurred, biotic interactions
   and spatial distribution of both conspecific and heterospecific groups
   of plains topminnow, plains killifish, and western mosquitofish were
   quantified in microcosms for three life stages (larval, juvenile, and
   adult). Interactions between adult western mosquitofish and the native
   species were complex and dependent upon life stage, but collectively
   suggested that populations of both plains topminnow and plains killifish
   are vulnerable to mosquitofish establishment. Detrimental effects
   towards fundulid species were primarily mediated through predation of
   larvae and aggressive interactions directed towards juvenile life stages
   which caused significant mortality. In addition, simultaneous
   alterations of behavior, as quantified by activity patterns and
   microhabitat use, were apparent in both native species in response to
   western mosquitofish presence. Because similar impacts of western
   mosquitofish were observed for plains killifish and plains topminnow,
   the persistence of plains killifish in areas occupied by western
   mosquitofish may be linked to species attributes not assessed in the
   current analysis. Subtle differences in microhabitat selection between
   the topminnow species and adult western mosquitofish could potentially
   explain observed differential displacement in the environment. These
   results have augmented our understanding of the impacts that western
   mosquitofish has on the at-risk plains topminnow, and have further
   elucidated the potential mechanisms for impact via competitive
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Marine organisms are simultaneously exposed to anthropogenic stressors
   with likely interactive effects, including synergisms in which the
   combined effects of multiple stressors are greater than the sum of
   individual effects. Early life stages of marine organisms are
   potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated with global change,
   but identifying general patterns across studies, species and response
   variables is challenging. This review represents the first meta-analysis
   of multistressor studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to
   larvae), particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are
   the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic
   stressors and early life stages are also identified. The meta-analysis
   yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic interactions (65\% of
   individual tests) are more common than additive (17\%) or antagonistic
   (17\%) interactions. (2) Larvae are generally more vulnerable than
   embryos to thermal and pH stress. (3) Survival is more likely than
   sublethal responses to be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress.
   (4) Interaction types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and
   biological responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5)
   Ocean acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than
   noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic than
   single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still oversimplify
   complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data from them must be
   cautiously interpreted with regard to extrapolation to field conditions.
   Nonetheless, our results identify taxa with early life stages that may
   be particularly vulnerable (e.g. molluscs, echinoderms) or robust (e.g.
   arthropods, cnidarians) to abiotic stress. We provide a list of
   recommendations for future multiple stressor studies, particularly those

Abstract = {{Assessment of the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific
   competition has increased in recent years and is critical to
   understanding the importance of competition. Yet, whether intra- and
   interspecific competition can have non-additive effects has rarely been
   tested. The resulting fitness consequences of such non-additive
   interactions are important to provide the context necessary to advance
   our understanding of competition theory. We compared the strength of
   additive and non-additive intra- and interspecific competition by
   manipulating densities of a pair of larval salamanders (Ambystoma
   talpoideum and A.maculatum) in experimental mesocosms within a response
   surface design. Intraspecific density had the strongest effect on the
   strength of competition for both species, and few observed comparisons
   indicated interspecific competition was an important factor in
   predicting body size, growth or larval period length of either species.
   Non-additive effects of intra- and interspecific competition influenced
   some response variables, including size and mass at metamorphosis in
   A.maculatum, but at a reduced strength compared to intraspecific effects
   alone. Intraspecific competition was thus the dominant biotic

   competition in these species, validating the importance of testing for

Abstract = {{The potential for complex synergistic or antagonistic interactions
   between multiple stressors presents one of the largest uncertainties
   when predicting ecological change but, despite common use of the terms
   in the scientific literature, a consensus on their operational
   definition is still lacking. The identification of synergism or
   antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the
   same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other,
   the definition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic
   to one stressor's effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In
   their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11,
   2008: 1304) assumed insituations with opposing individual effects that
   synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the
   additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this
   and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects
   model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the
   cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of mitigating
   synergism is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and
   enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset
   compiled by Crain etal. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine
   the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions.
   Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the
   representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we
   document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance
   of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the
   determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly
   pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and
   reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative). We
   emphasize the need for reconsideration by the ecological community of
   the interpretation of synergism and antagonism insituations where
   individual stressor effects oppose each other or where cumulative
   effects are reversed and enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{1. Coexistence of predators that share the same prey is common. This is
   still the case in size-structured predator communities where predators
   consume prey species of different sizes (interspecific prey responses)
   or consume different size classes of the same species of prey
   (intraspecific prey responses). A mechanism has recently been proposed
   to explain coexistence between predators that differ in size but share
   the same prey species, emergent facilitation, which is dependent on
   strong intraspecific responses from one or more prey species. Under
   emergent facilitation, predators can depend on each other for invasion,
   persistence or success in a size-structured prey community. Experimental
   evidence for intraspecific size-structured responses in prey populations
   remains rare, and further questions remain about direct interactions
   between predators that could prevent or limit any positive effects
   between predators {[}e.g. intraguild predation (IGP)]. Here, we provide
   a community-wide experiment on emergent facilitation including natural
   predators. We investigate both the direct interactions between two
   predators that differ in body size (fish vs. invertebrate predator), and
   the indirect interaction between them via their shared prey community
   (zooplankton). Our evidence supports the most likely expectation of
   interactions between differently sized predators that IGP rates are
   high, and interspecific interactions in the shared prey community
   dominate the response to predation (i.e. predator-mediated competition).
   The question of whether emergent facilitation occurs frequently in

   to address the likelihood that its pre-conditions may co-occur with high

   Structure and Function in an Intermittent Stream}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Top predator loss is a major global problem, with a current trend in
   biodiversity loss towards high trophic levels that modifies most
   ecosystems worldwide. Most research in this area is focused on
   large-bodied predators, despite the high extinction risk of small-bodied
   freshwater fish that often act as apex consumers. Consequently, it
   remains unknown if intermittent streams are affected by the consequences
   of top-predators' extirpations. The aim of our research was to determine
   how this global problem affects intermittent streams and, in particular,
   if the loss of a small-bodied top predator (1) leads to a `mesopredator
   release', affects primary consumers and changes whole community
   structures, and (2) triggers a cascade effect modifying the ecosystem
   function. To address these questions, we studied the top-down effects of
   a small endangered fish species, Barbus meridionalis (the Mediterranean
   barbel), conducting an enclosure/exclosure mesocosm experiment in an
   intermittent stream where B. meridionalis became locally extinct
   following a wildfire. We found that top predator absence led to
   `mesopredator release', and also to `prey release' despite intraguild
   predation, which contrasts with traditional food web theory. In
   addition, B. meridionalis extirpation changed whole macroinvertebrate
   community composition and increased total macroinvertebrate density.
   Regarding ecosystem function, periphyton primary production decreased in
   apex consumer absence. In this study, the apex consumer was functionally
   irreplaceable; its local extinction led to the loss of an important
   functional role that resulted in major changes to the ecosystem's
   structure and function. This study evidences that intermittent streams
   can be affected by the consequences of apex consumers' extinctions, and
   that the loss of small-bodied top predators can lead to large ecosystem
   changes. We recommend the reintroduction of small-bodied apex consumers
   to systems where they have been extirpated, to restore ecosystem
   structure and function.}},

   in recruitment, survival, growth, or fecundity). We highlight several
   factors that can interact with the effects of competition and make it

Abstract = {{Native communities are thought to mediate the establishment and
   performance of invasive species through competitive and consumptive
   interactions, a concept referred to as ``biotic resistance.'' We
   investigated the generality of this concept across ecosystems. Despite
   the conspicuousness of freshwater invasions, investigations of biotic
   resistance have focused mostly on terrestrial and, more recently, marine
   coastal communities. We collected in-situ studies that tested the
   impacts of native freshwater communities on invading primary producers
   and consumers. Meta-analysis demonstrated that evidence of competitive
   biotic resistance in freshwater habitats was not as strong as that in
   marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In freshwater ecosystems consumptive
   resistance was significantly stronger than competitive resistance and
   consumptive resistance appeared to be as strong in freshwater as in
   marine and terrestrial systems. The limited number of studies
   considering freshwater biotic resistance hindered our ability to
   understand the importance of factors including latitude, experimental
   duration, and method. However, the strength of biotic resistance varied
   among freshwater habitats; specifically, biotic resistance was strongest
   in lentic environments. Our analysis identifies mechanisms underlying
   biotic resistance in freshwater ecosystems that warrant further
   investigation given the potential ongoing and future impacts of invasive
   species in these systems.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Large consumers are important in determining community structure and
   have been extensively researched. The impact of predation on
   hard-substrate marine invertebrate communities tends to be mixed.
   Numerous exclusion studies fail to incorporate appropriate procedural
   controls or account for meso-predators. An experimental exclusion study
   was performed to investigate the effects of large predators on the
   development of hard-substrate invertebrate assemblages, whilst
   simultaneously quantifying changes in the abundances of meso-predators.
   Settlement plates were deployed subtidally and were either caged (to
   exclude large predators), placed in cage controls or left exposed to
   predation. Assemblages were collected and censused after 9, 14 and 19
   weeks. The overall structure of the communities differed due to
   predation, and this effect was consistent through time. Encrusting
   bryozoans and hydroids occupied more space on exposed surfaces. Amphipod
   tube cover was greater in caged treatments, with the magnitude of the
   difference increasing through time, whilst solitary ascidian cover was
   greater on caged treatments in week 19 only. Mesa-predators varied in
   their responses to large predators, with whelks more abundant in the
   absence of predators, whereas flatworm abundance was greater where
   predators were present. Our study demonstrated that strong effects of
   predators on particular taxa was able to alter the overall community
   composition, with the cascading effects of large predators on
   mesa-predator abundances potentially contributing to this outcome. (C)

Abstract = {{Many aquatic ecosystems sustain multiple invasive species and
   interactions among them have important implications for ecosystem
   structure and functioning. Here, we examine interactions among two pairs
   of invasive crayfish species because of their close proximity and thus
   chance of sympatric populations in the near future within the Thames
   catchment, U.K. (signal, Pacifastacus leniusculus and virile crayfish,
   Orconectes virilis within a river system; red swamp, Procambarus clarkii
   and Turkish crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus found within a suite of
   ponds). We address two questions: do sympatric invasive crayfish occupy
   a smaller niche than their allopatric counterparts due to potential
   resource competition? and do interactions among invasive species amplify
   or mitigate one another's impacts on the ecosystem?
   Two fully factorial mesocosm experiments (one for each crayfish pair)
   were used to investigate crayfish diet and their impact on benthic
   invertebrate community structure, benthic algal standing stock and leaf
   litter decomposition rates in allopatric and sympatric populations,
   compared with a crayfish-free control. We used stable isotope analysis
   to examine crayfish diet in the mesocosms and in allopatric populations
   of each species in the Thames catchment.
   Isotopic niche width did not vary significantly between allopatric and
   sympatric populations of crayfish in the mesocosm experiments, and
   isotopic niche partitioning in all the wild populations suggests the
   invaders can coexist.
   All four species altered benthic invertebrate community structure but
   with differing functional effects, often mediated via trophic cascades.
   Red swamp crayfish predation upon snails evidently promoted benthic
   algal standing stock via reduction in grazing pressure. However, a
   trophic cascade whereby the crayfish consumed native invertebrate
   shredders, causing a reduction in net leaf litter decomposition, was
   decoupled by red swamp and signal crayfish since they consumed leaf
   litter directly and thus moderated the cascade to a trickle when in
   sympatry with Turkish or virile crayfish, respectively.
   Benthic invertebrate predator abundance was significantly reduced by
   sympatric red swamp and Turkish crayfish but not independently when in
   allopatry, indicating an amplified effect overall when in sympatry.
   Our results suggest that the combined effect of multiple invasions on
   the ecosystem can reflect either an additive effect of their independent
   impacts or an amplified effect, which is greater than the sum of their
   independent impacts. A lack of general pattern in their effects makes
   any potential management strategy more complex.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion of invasive species in new host habitats is mediated by a
   combination of concurrent biotic and abiotic factors. Xenostrobus
   securis is an invasive mussel species that is spreading in the inner
   part of the Galician Rias Baixas, particularly in areas of low salinity.
   It co-occurs with the commercially important blue mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis in mixed patchy aggregations on intertidal shores. We
   asked whether biotic interactions, i.e. competition, facilitation and
   predation, could explain patterns of coexistence of the 2 species in an
   estuarine habitat. We also examined whether the effects of such
   interactions were dependent upon the environmental context. We
   manipulated predator access to synthetic aggregations of juvenile
   mussels at different sites using monospecific aggregations of X. securis
   and M. galloprovincialis and mixed aggregations at high and low
   densities. Performance of the species was measured as survivorship,
   growth and condition index. Predation played an important role in
   determining abundances of both species, especially in the case of the
   invader, although the effects on survivorship were context dependent. We
   did not find evidence of intra-or inter-specific competition. Growth
   rates of the invader were affected by environmental variability (i.e.
   significant site effect). Condition index of M. galloprovincialis
   improved in high density aggregations (monospecific and mixed), but only
   towards the sea (i.e. the outermost site). Results suggest that
   facilitative rather than competitive interactions contribute to the
   abundance patterns of the 2 species, at least during the juvenile stage.
   The environmental context was an important driver of such patterns. We
   emphasise the need to address the role of positive interactions
   regarding marine non-indigenous species.}},

Abstract = {{At temperate latitudes densities and biomass of intertidal molluscs tend
   to be strongly seasonal. Here we provide a comparative study on
   seasonality of bivalves and gastropods in the tropical intertidal
   seagrass-covered soft sediment environment of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania
   (20 degrees N, 16 degrees W). In this system, benthivorous shorebirds
   exert considerable predation pressure with strong seasonal variations.
   It has been proposed that during the period when (adult) shorebirds are
   absent (May-August) benthic biomass would be able to recover, but a
   first test was inconclusive. Over a full year (March 2011-February
   2012), each month we sampled benthic invertebrates at sixteen permanent
   sites. The total of 3763 specimens comprised 20 species, representing
   eight orders and 19 families. Bivalves were much more common than
   gastropods. The bivalve Loripes lucinalis dominated the assemblage
   throughout the year (58\% of total number), followed by Dosinia
   isocardia (10\%), Senilia senilis (8\%) and the gastropod Gibbula
   umbilicalis (6\%). Average biomass amounted to 32 g AFDM/m(2), of which
   the large West-African bloody cockle Senilia made up three-quarter,
   Loripes 16\%, Gibbula 2\% and Dosinia 1\%. Across the 20 species, lowest
   densities were reached in late spring (May) and summer (Aug.), whereas
   highest densities occurred in autumn (Oct.). The lowest overall density
   of 676 specimens/m(2) in August more than doubled to a peak density of
   1538 specimens/m(2) in October, most of the increase being due to strong
   recruitment in both Loripes (densities increasing from 322
   specimens/m(2) in Sept. to 785 specimens/m(2) in Oct.) and Dosinia
   (densities increasing from 18 specimens/m(2) in Aug. to 265
   specimens/m(2) in Sept.). Our results suggest that by the time the
   feathered molluscivore predators returned in high numbers to Banc
   d'Arguin (after their summer breeding season in the Arctic), benthic
   animals were at a peak. In order to quantitatively understand the
   seasonal changes in mollusc abundance, we build upon a recently
   published optimal diet model in which the most abundant molluscivore
   shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), could choose between Loripes
   and Dosinia. Observed changes in densities of these two bivalves closely
   match depletion trajectories predicted by the model. We conclude that
   molluscivore shorebirds are able to deplete their food stocks in the
   course of their `winter' in a tropical intertidal area. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Impacts of marine invaders on local biodiversity have not been analyzed
   across invasive species and invaded habitats. We conducted a
   meta-analysis of 56 field experiments published in 29 papers that
   examined the effects of marine invaders on local species richness,
   diversity, and/or evenness. We show that invaders, across studies,
   typically have negative effects on biodiversity within a trophic level
   but positive effects on biodiversity of higher trophic levels. For
   example, both plants and sessile filter-feeders had positive effects on
   richness and diversity of mobile consumers. The contrasting negative and
   positive effects on similar versus higher trophic levels are potentially
   manifested through community-wide antagonism (competition and
   consumption) versus facilitation (habitat and food provisioning)
   interactions, respectively. These relation ships extended to functional
   interactions, as sessile invaders had negative effects on the
   biodiversity of sessile communities (intra-functional interactions) but
   positive effects on the biodiversity of mobile communities
   (inter-functional interactions). Our analyses highlight the importance
   of pairing attributes of the invader and the impacted organisms to
   obtain simple predictions of how the diversity of entire communities may
   respond to species invasions on local scales. We also note that our

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can facilitate nutrient uptake and
   increase host plant growth but also place constraints on the host's
   carbon budget. When plants are stressed by herbivory the net effect of
   the symbiosis may be altered tolerance. Individual experiments
   manipulating AM fungi and herbivory have demonstrated increased,
   decreased, and no effect on tolerance but patterns with respect to
   plant, herbivore, or fungus characteristics have not emerged.
   Meta-analysis of published results from factorial experiments was used
   to describe the size of the effects of herbivory and of AM fungi on host
   growth when factors such as cause of damage, inoculum, and host
   characteristics are considered, and to determine whether AM fungi alter
   the effects of herbivory. Also, the correlation between the effect of AM
   fungi on tolerance and resistance was tested with data from studies that
   examined insect performance. Herbivory strongly and consistently reduced
   shoot and root growth, especially in perennial plants and crops. AM
   fungi increased shoot growth of perennials but not annuals, and when
   insects caused damage but not when artificial defoliation was applied.
   Root growth was consistently greater with AM fungi. The interaction of
   AM fungi and herbivory, which indicates whether AM fungi alter the
   effects of herbivory, was variable and never significant overall but
   homogeneity tests indicated underlying structure. In experiments that
   used single species inoculum, Glomus intraradices increased, whereas
   Glomus mosseae reduced, effects of herbivory on shoot growth.
   Multispecies inocula magnified effects of herbivory on root growth
   whereas single species inocula ameliorated effects. The impact of AM
   fungi on resistance to herbivory was positively correlated with the
   impact on tolerance; however AM fungi reduced both tolerance and
   resistance in many cases. Review of these results with respect to the
   types of systems studied suggests directions for future investigation.

Volume = {{172}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the consequences of predator biodiversity loss on prey
   requires an understanding of multiple predator interactions. Predators
   are often assumed to have independent and additive effects on shared
   prey survival; however, multiple predator effects can be non-additive if
   predators foraging together reduce prey survival (risk enhancement) or
   increase prey survival through interference (risk reduction). In marine
   communities, juvenile reef fish experience very high mortality from two
   predator guilds with very different hunting modes and foraging
   domains-benthic and pelagic predator guilds. The few previous predator
   manipulation studies have found or assumed that mortality is independent
   and additive. We tested whether interacting predator guilds result in
   non-additive prey mortality and whether the detection of such effects
   change over time as prey are depleted. To do so, we examined the roles
   of benthic and pelagic predators on the survival of a juvenile shoaling
   zooplanktivorous temperate reef fish, Trachinops caudimaculatus, on
   artificial patch reefs over 2 months in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We
   observed risk enhancement in the first 7 days, as shoaling behaviour
   placed prey between predator foraging domains with no effective refuge.
   At day 14 we observed additive mortality, and risk enhancement was no
   longer detectable. By days 28 and 62, pelagic predators were no longer
   significant sources of mortality and additivity was trivial. We
   hypothesize that declines in prey density led to reduced shoaling
   behaviour that brought prey more often into the domain of benthic
   predators, resulting in limited mortality from pelagic predators.
   Furthermore, pelagic predators may have spent less time patrolling reefs
   in response to declines in prey numbers. Our observation of the changing
   interaction between predators and prey has important implications for
   assessing the role of predation in regulating populations in complex
   communities.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Since typically there are many predators feeding on most herbivores in
   natural communities, understanding multiple predator effects is critical
   for both community and applied ecology. Experiments of multiple predator
   effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, as the number of
   treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments
   increases exponentially with the number of species in question.
   Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species
   and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in
   experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional
   responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for
   such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally
   predict qualitatively different results, if initial absolute densities
   of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are
   maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without
   varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this
   prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a
   system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata
   (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared
   prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the
   absolute initial densities of the species in question. Even if their
   relative densities are kept constant, the natural enemy species or
   combination thereof that most effectively suppresses the prey may depend
   on the absolute initial densities used in the experiment. Future
   empirical studies of multiple predator - one prey interactions should
   therefore use a two-dimensional array of initial densities of the
   studied species. Varying only combinations of natural enemies without
   varying their densities is not sufficient and can lead to misleading
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Environmentally cued plasticity in hatching timing is widespread in
   animals. As with later life-history switch points, plasticity in
   hatching timing may have carryover effects that affect subsequent
   interactions with predators and competitors. Moreover, the strength of
   such effects of hatching plasticity may be context dependent. We used
   red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, to test for lasting effects
   of hatching timing (four or six days post-oviposition) under factorial
   combinations of resource levels (high or low) and predation risk (none,
   caged, or lethal Pantala flavescens dragonfly naiads). Tadpoles were
   raised in 400-L mesocosms in Gamboa, Panama, from hatching until all
   animals had metamorphosed or died, allowing assessment of effects across
   a nearly six-month period of metamorphosis. Hatching early reduced
   survival to metamorphosis, increased larval growth, and had
   context-dependent effects on metamorph phenotypes. Early during the
   period of metamorph emergence, early-hatched animals were larger than
   late-hatched ones, but this effect attenuated over time. Early-hatched
   animals also left the water with relatively longer tails. Lethal
   predators dramatically reduced survival to metamorphosis, with most
   mortality occurring early in the larval period. Predator effects on the
   timing of metamorphosis and metamorph size and tail length depended upon
   resources. For example, lethal predators reduced larval periods, and
   this effect was stronger with low resources. Predators affected
   metamorph size early in the period of metamorphosis, whereas resource
   levels were a stronger determinant of phenotype for animals that
   metamorphosed later. Effects of hatching timing were detectable on top
   of strong effects of larval predators and resources, across two
   subsequent life stages, and some were as strong as or stronger than
   effects of resources. Plasticity in hatching timing is ecologically
   important and currently underappreciated. Effects on metamorph numbers
   and phenotypes may impact subsequent interactions with predators,
   competitors, and mates, with potentially cascading effects on
   recruitment and fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean acidification and warming are considered two of the greatest
   threats to marine biodiversity, yet the combined effect of these
   stressors on marine organisms remains largely unclear. Using a
   meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine
   organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation
   and combination. As expected biological responses varied across
   taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but
   importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger
   biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of
   orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological
   responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and
   survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and
   acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting
   stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from
   single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the
   development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that
   the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely
   to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward
   more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change
   experiments that incorporate interactions. Without them accurate
   predictions about the likely deleterious impacts to marine biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning over the next century will not be possible.}},

Abstract = {{The painted frog, Discoglossus pictus, was introduced into the Iberian
   Peninsula 100 years ago and its distribution has steadily increased
   since then. We studied the effects of this non-native amphibian species
   on the native ones in the northeastern area of the peninsula. We
   compared amphibian assemblages in regions with and without D. pictus to
   estimate niche overlap between species. Additionally, we carried out a
   laboratory evaluation of the effects of competition between the
   non-native and the two native species with which it overlaps most
   commonly: Bufo calamita and Pelodytes punctatus. The presence of D.
   pictus larvae reduced the survival, body mass and activity of B.
   calamita, and increased time to metamorphosis. Furthermore, D. pictus
   showed the highest consumption rate while P. punctatus showed the
   lowest. One possible consequence of these competitive interactions is an
   alteration of species co-occurrence patterns in the recipient community
   on a regional scale. In the non-invaded area, the checkerboard score
   (C-score) of co-occurrence indicated that the community was structured,
   whereas the standardized C-score in the invaded area indicated that the
   community did not differ significantly from having a random structure.
   These results suggest that competition between native and non-native
   species can cause recipient communities to become less structured.}},

Abstract = {{Among species interactions, competition is obviously more nuanced to
   investigate than predation. Certainly there have been copious, seminal
   works on competition in marine and freshwater ecosystems, most often on
   research executed at smaller ecological scales such as rocky intertidal
   zones, coral reefs, or littoral zones, and often involving experimental
   manipulation. Such studies have typically emphasized organisms with
   relatively high site fidelity, and all have focused primarily at the
   individual level. Here we springboard from those studies to explore
   competition among marine fishes at broader spatiotemporal scales, scales
   at which fish populations are distributed, scales at which their
   associated fisheries operate and are managed, and as observed under
   ambient (i.e., nonexperimental) system dynamics. Inferring that
   competition might be occurring among marine fishes requires four
   conditions: opposite population trajectories, high spatiotemporal
   overlap, high dietary overlap, and some indication of resource
   limitation. We used those criteria to examine cases of species pairings
   from the Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem to ascertain if
   there are broadly applicable rules of thumb to determine when
   competition might be a significant consideration. We assert that such
   rules exist, and where competition is strongly suspected, we provide an
   empirically based method of calculating first-order, model-free
   interaction terms that can scope the potential magnitude of competitive
   effects. We do so very much cognizant of several caveats and theoretical
   considerations; but our main premise is that estimating and evaluating
   competition for marine fishes from extant, commonly available data is
   feasible, is highly germane, and has many valuable applications for
   multispecies and ecosystem models as we move toward ecosystem-based
   fisheries management.}},

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus plantations cover more than 20 Mha worldwide and are almost
   exclusively monospecific. However, in native forests Eucalyptus species
   often grow in mixtures. Mixed species stands of trees can be more
   productive than monospecific stands but despite the implications of this
   effect, for plantations and native Eucalyptus forests, the effects of
   mixing eucalypts has received little attention. The aim of this study
   was to examine whether two species that naturally coexist (Eucalyptus
   grandis W. Hill and Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.) grow faster in mixtures
   than their respective monocultures. Monocultures and 1:1 mixtures, and
   stands of two initial planting densities (1250 and 2500 trees ha(-1)),
   were used to compare the productivity and stand structures of mixtures
   and monocultures and to quantify inter- and intra-specific competition.
   Interactions between these Eucalyptus species increased their relative
   yields in mixtures by 10-30\%. This was associated with changes in stand
   structure where the diameter distributions of both species became less
   positively skewed (lower proportions of small trees). Mixing effects
   were relatively consistent as the stands developed suggesting that if
   this complementarity effect is used in plantations there is considerable
   silvicultural flexibility, such that these mixed plantations could be
   used on both shorter rotations for biomass or pulp-logs as well as
   longer rotations for solid wood products. This study also suggests that
   interactions between co-occurring Eucalyptus species in natural forests
   might actually facilitate individual tree growth, in addition to simply
   enabling co-existence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Top-down effects of predators in systems depend on the rate at which
   predators consume prey, and on predator preferences among available
   prey. In invaded communities, these parameters might be difficult to
   predict because ecological relationships are typically evolutionarily
   novel. We examined feeding rates and preferences of a crab native to the
   Pacific Northwest, Cancer productus, among four prey items: two invasive
   species of oyster drill (the marine whelks Urosalpinx cinerea and
   Ocenebra inornata) and two species of oyster (Crassostrea gigas and
   Ostrea lurida) that are also consumed by U. cinerea and O. inornata.
   This system is also characterized by intraguild predation because crabs
   are predators of drills and compete with them for prey (oysters). When
   only the oysters were offered, crabs did not express a preference and
   consumed approximately 9 juvenile oysters crab(-1) day(-1). We then
   tested whether crabs preferred adult drills of either U. cinerea or O.
   inornata, or juvenile oysters (C. gigas). While crabs consumed drills
   and oysters at approximately the same rate when only one type of prey
   was offered, they expressed a strong preference for juvenile oysters
   over drills when they were allowed to choose among the three prey items.
   This preference for oysters might negate the positive indirect effects
   that crabs have on oysters by crabs consuming drills (trophic cascade)
   because crabs have a large negative direct effect on oysters when crabs,
   oysters, and drills co-occur. Citation: Grason EW, Miner BG (2012)

Abstract = {{An important challenge for conservation is a quantitative understanding
   of how multiple human stressors will interact to mitigate or exacerbate
   global environmental change at a community or ecosystem level. We
   explored the interaction effects of fishing, ocean warming, and ocean
   acidification over time on 60 functional groups of species in the
   southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative
   biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that
   included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and
   management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and
   interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top
   predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary
   producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects
   with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic
   (amplified stress), additive (no additional stress), or antagonistic
   (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative
   effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming
   with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding
   fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed
   the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic
   response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response
   level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size,
   direction, and type of interaction effect varied depending on the
   combination of stressors. Top predator and fish biomass had a
   synergistic response to the interaction of all three stressors, whereas
   biomass of benthic invertebrates responded antagonistically. With our
   approach, we were able to identify the regional effects of fishing on
   the size and direction of the interacting effects of ocean warming and

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that soil nutrient heterogeneity, a ubiquitous
   feature of terrestrial ecosystems, modulates plant responses to ongoing
   global change (GC). However, we know little about the overall trends of
   such responses, the GC drivers involved and the plant attributes
   affected. We synthesized literature to answer the question: Does soil
   heterogeneity significantly affect plant responses to main GC drivers,
   such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2),
   nitrogen (N) enrichment and changes in rainfall regime? Overall, most
   studies have addressed short-term effects of N enrichment on the
   performance of model plant communities using experiments conducted under
   controlled conditions. The role of soil heterogeneity as a modulator of
   plant responses to elevated CO2 may depend on the plasticity in nutrient
   uptake patterns. Soil heterogeneity does interact with N enrichment to
   determine plant growth and nutrient status, but the outcome of this
   interaction has been found to be both synergistic and inhibitory. The
   very few studies published on interactive effects of soil heterogeneity
   and changes in rainfall regime prevented us from identifying any general
   pattern. We identify the long-term consequences of soil heterogeneity on
   plant community dynamics in the field, and the ecosystem-level responses
   of the soil heterogeneity x GC driver interaction, as the main knowledge
   gaps in this area of research. To fill these gaps and take soil
   heterogeneity and GC research a step forward, we propose the following
   research guidelines: (i) combining morphological and physiological plant
   responses to soil heterogeneity with field observations of community
   composition and predictions from simulation models and (ii)
   incorporating soil heterogeneity into a trait-based response-effect
   framework, where plant-resource-use traits are used as both response
   variables to this heterogeneity and GC, and predictors of ecosystem
   functioning. Synthesis. There is enough evidence to affirm that soil
   heterogeneity modulates plant responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 and
   N enrichment. Our synthesis indicates that we must explicitly consider
   soil heterogeneity to accurately predict plant responses to GC drivers.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1013-1023}},

Abstract = {{1. Understanding how variation in fitness relates to variation in group
   living remains critical to determine whether this major aspect of social
   behaviour is currently adaptive. 2. Available evidence in social mammals
   aimed to examine this issue remains controversial. Studies show positive
   (i.e. potentially adaptive), neutral or even negative fitness effects of
   group living. 3. Attempts to explain this variation rely on intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors to social groups. Thus, relatively more positive
   fitness effects are predicted in singularly breeding as opposed to
   plural breeding species. Fitness effects of sociality in turn may depend
   on ecological conditions (i.e. extrinsic factors) that influence
   associated benefits and costs. 4. We used meta-analytic tools to review
   how breeding strategy or ecological conditions influence the effect size
   associated with direct fitness-sociality relationships reported in the
   mammalian literature. Additionally, we determined how taxonomic
   affiliation of species studied, different fitness and sociality measures
   used, and major climatic conditions of study sites explained any
   variation in direct fitness effect size. 5. We found group living had
   modest, yet positive effects on direct fitness. This generally adaptive
   scenario was contingent not only upon breeding strategy and climate of
   study sites, but also on fitness measures examined. Thus, positive and
   significant effects characterized singular as opposed to plural breeding
   strategies. 6. We found more positive fitness effects on studies
   conducted in tropical as opposed to temperate or arid climates. More
   positive and significant effects were noted on studies that relied on
   group fecundity, male fecundity and offspring survival as measures of
   fitness. 7. To conclude, direct fitness consequences of mammalian group
   living are driven by interspecific differences in breeding strategy and
   climate conditions. Other factors not examined in this study, namely
   individual variation in direct and indirect fitness benefits and
   potential interactions between social and ecological conditions, may be
   important and require further studies.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-analyses are an increasingly used set of statistical tools that
   allow for data from multiple studies to be drawn together allowing
   broader, more generalizable conclusions. The extent to which the
   increase in the number of meta-analyses in ecology, relative to other
   types of papers, has influenced how questions are asked and the current
   state of knowledge has not been assessed before. Here, we gauge the
   impact of meta-analyses in ecology quantitatively and qualitatively. For
   the quantitative assessment, we conducted an analysis of 240 published
   meta-analyses to examine trends in ecological meta-analyses. Our
   examination shows that publication rates of meta-analyses in ecology
   have increased through time, and that more recent meta-analyses have
   been more comprehensive, including more studies and a greater temporal
   range of studies. Meta-analyses in ecology are the result of larger
   collaborations with meta-analyses being authored by larger teams than
   other studies, and those funded by collaborative centers have even
   larger collaborations. These larger collaborations result in a larger
   scope and scale of the analyses-by using more papers, datasets, species
   and years of data. Qualitatively, we discuss three examples: the
   strength of competition, the nature of how biodiversity affects
   ecosystem function, and the response of species to global climate
   change, where meta-analyses supplied the critical evaluation of accepted
   ecological explanations. As scientific criticism and controversy mount,
   the true power of meta-analyses is to serve as the capstone evidence
   supporting the validity of an explanation and to possibly herald the

Abstract = {{Many studies have assessed the impact of different pollutants on
   amphibians across a variety of experimental venues (laboratory,
   mesocosm, and enclosure conditions). Past reviews, using vote-counting
   methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by
   amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical
   power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do
   not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these
   challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that
   measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and
   phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other
   wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on
   amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and
   frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant
   exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a
   large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3\%
   decrease in survival, a 7.5\% decrease in mass, and a 535\% increase in
   abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no
   overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to
   metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among
   experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected
   weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that
   variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of
   phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was
   detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among
   stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on
   amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that
   pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important
   threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global
   decline.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of predation may cascade down the food web. By alleviating
   interspecific competition among prey, predators may promote
   biodiversity, but the precise mechanisms of how predators alter
   competition have remained elusive. Here we report on a
   predator-exclosure experiment carried out in a tropical intertidal
   ecosystem, providing evidence for a three-level trophic cascade induced
   by predation by molluscivore Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that affects
   pore water biogeochemistry. In the exclosures the knots' favorite prey
   (Dosinia isocardia) became dominant and reduced the individual growth
   rate in an alternative prey (Loripes lucinalis). Dosinia, a suspension
   feeder, consumes suspended particulate organic matter (POM), whereas
   Loripes is a facultative mixotroph, partly living on metabolites
   produced by sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, but also
   consuming suspended POM. Reduced sulfide concentrations in the
   exclosures suggest that, without predation on Dosinia, stronger
   competition for suspended POM forces Loripes to rely on energy produced
   by endosymbiotic bacteria, thus leading to an enhanced uptake of sulfide
   from the surrounding pore water. As sulfide is toxic to most organisms,
   this competition-induced diet shift by Loripes may detoxify the

Abstract = {{The aggregation model of coexistence suggests that intraspecific
   aggregation in local patches decreases richness locally, but increases
   richness regionally. While this model has largely been applied to
   competing species, it may also apply to predator-prey systems if
   predators influence intraspecific aggregation in their prey. Predators
   may influence intraspecific aggregation in prey communities by affecting
   prey immigration, emigration, and survival (both directly through
   predation and indirectly by modifying prey interactions and behavior).
   We performed a field experiment to determine whether predators influence
   the composition and aggregation of their macroinvertebrate prey in a
   marine subtidal food web. We quantified prey colonization of eight
   treatments that differed in the composition and richness of predators.
   We found between 50\% and 70\% of species exhibited positive
   intraspecific aggregation. We then asked whether the observed patterns
   in intraspecific aggregation among prey influenced local (alpha)
   diversity and turnover between local patches (beta diversity).
   Intraspecific aggregation was positively correlated with both alpha and
   beta diversity. The positive relationship between intraspecific
   aggregation and beta diversity was expected, however, the positive
   relationship between intraspecific aggregation and alpha diversity was
   not and runs counter to the negative relationship found in competitive
   communities. We suggest that the positive relationship we observed could
   occur because aggregation can increase prey survival and can generate a
   type III functional response. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The introduction of invasive alien predators often has catastrophic
   effects on populations of na < ve native prey, but in situations where
   prey survive the initial impact a predator may act as a strong selective
   agent for prey that can discriminate and avoid it. Using two common
   species of Australian small mammals that have persisted in the presence
   of an alien predator, the European red fox Vulpes vulpes, for over a
   century, we hypothesised that populations of both would perform better
   where the activity of the predator was low than where it was high and
   that prey individuals would avoid signs of the predator's presence. We
   found no difference in prey abundance in sites with high and low fox
   activity, but survival of one species-the bush rat Rattus fuscipes-was
   almost twofold higher where fox activity was low. Juvenile, but not
   adult rats, avoided fox odour on traps, as did individuals of the second
   prey species, the brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii. Both species
   also showed reduced activity at foraging trays bearing fox odour in
   giving-up density (GUD) experiments, although GUDs and avoidance of fox
   odour declined over time. Young rats avoided fox odour more strongly
   where fox activity was high than where it was low, but neither adult R.
   fuscipes nor A. stuartii responded differently to different levels of
   fox activity. Conservation managers often attempt to eliminate alien
   predators or to protect predator-na < ve prey in protected reserves. Our
   results suggest that, if predator pressure can be reduced, otherwise
   susceptible prey may survive the initial impact of an alien predator,
   and experience selection to discriminate cues to its presence and avoid
   it over the longer term. Although predator reduction is often feasible,
   identifying the level of reduction that will conserve prey and allow
   selection for avoidance remains an important challenge.}},

Abstract = {{A common effect size metric used to quantify the outcome of experiments

   Here, I derive new variances and covariances for RR for several

   when means are based on repeated measures; and when the study has a

Abstract = {{Invasive species have transformed local, regional and global biotas;

   unique attributes are distinct to a specific invasion. For example,
   impacts associated with the abundance of any invader or the properties
   of a specific invader (e.g., a rare toxin) represent a universal and
   unique impact attribute. Through meta-analyses of aquatic field
   experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our framework, documenting
   that both the abundance and the taxonomic identity of the invader
   significantly influence invasion outcomes for marine and freshwater
   plant and animal invaders. Our review also highlights that many more

   priority effects, age and size, and how the attributes of the invaded

Abstract = {{Animals respond to alarm calls by increasing their antipredator
   behavior; however, responses may consistently differ by age or sex.
   Although several adaptive explanations have been proposed to account for
   age-dependent antipredator behavior, similar explanations are rarely
   extended to sex-specific responses. Furthermore, no attempts have been
   made to quantitatively estimate the direction or magnitude of these
   differences across studies. Here, we use meta-analysis to discover
   overall trends in the literature, as well as differences owing to
   experimental or population parameters. Across our sample of available
   studies (unfortunately biased toward rodents and primates), males
   respond more than females, and young respond more than adults.
   Furthermore, young of quickly maturing species display more adult-like
   antipredator behavior than young of slowly maturing species, suggesting
   that young must develop antipredator behavior at a pace consistent with
   the length of their ontogenetic period (a.k.a. juvenile/sub-adult
   period, defined as the time between birth and attainment of sexual
   maturity). We review previously proposed explanations for such age
   differences, namely, that longer ontogenetic periods may provide
   juveniles with time to develop behavior through learning and experience,
   or, maturation rates may influence age-specific selection pressures and
   the consequent evolution of age-specific behavioral strategies. We
   evaluate our results in light of these hypotheses, although our
   conclusions are limited by the number and taxonomic bias of available
   studies. We therefore suggest ways in which future studies may tease
   apart the relative importance of learning and experience vs.
   age-specific adaptive behavior, and draw attention to opportunities for
   research on age-and sex-specific alarm call responses.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies in temperate regions have revealed that competition

   examine the independent and combined effects of competition and
   predation on the survival and growth of hatchling tadpoles of two
   widespread co-occurring Neotropical hylid frogs (Agalychnis callidryas
   and Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Using 400 L mesocosms, we used a 2 x 3
   factorial substitutive design, which crossed tadpole species composition
   with the presence or absence of a free-roaming predator (Anax amazili

   of both species and erased this asymmetry. Results suggest that the
   effects of predator induction (i.e., nonconsumptive effects) on growth

   demonstrates that predators have strong effects on both survival and

   Acanthaster showed feeding preferences, resulting in varying intensities

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is commonly considered as a trait associated with
   invasiveness in alien plants because it may enhance the ability of
   plants to occupy a wide range of environments. Although the evidence of
   greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is
   not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether
   invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their
   native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific
   comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken
   into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus,
   tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies
   reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory
   and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall,
   phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or
   non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when
   separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients,
   light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their
   native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying
   functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of
   a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their
   capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to
   their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic
   plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the
   initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for
   plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as
   invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after
   selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification
   of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile
   task because different traits favor invasiveness in different
   environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of
   specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global
   macro-analyses.}},

Abstract = {{This review considers how natural weedy vegetation affects herbivory in
   arable crops, and how such `associational effects may be set against
   other factors affecting crop yield that are better understood, such as

   herbivory by three broad categories of mechanisms: (1) directly, by
   altering the behaviour of herbivores, (2) indirectly by altering the
   behaviour of natural enemies or (3) indirectly by altering crop plants'
   growth and physiology. The first category includes natural vegetation
   diverting herbivores away from crop plants, which appears to be the most
   beneficial effect, but this is sensitive to the spatial scales at which
   herbivores forage. There is little evidence that mechanisms in the
   second category significantly affect crop performance. The viability of
   crops is critically dependent on the dynamics of plant-plant
   interactions (the third category) and their interactions with

Title = {{How Predation and Landscape Fragmentation Affect Vole Population
   Dynamics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microtine species in Fennoscandia display a distinct
   north-south gradient from regular cycles to stable populations. The
   gradient has often been attributed to changes in the interactions
   between microtines and their predators. Although the spatial structure
   of the environment is known to influence predator-prey dynamics of a
   wide range of species, it has scarcely been considered in relation to
   the Fennoscandian gradient. Furthermore, the length of microtine
   breeding season also displays a north-south gradient. However, little
   consideration has been given to its role in shaping or generating
   population cycles. Because these factors covary along the gradient it is
   difficult to distinguish their effects experimentally in the field. The
   distinction is here attempted using realistic agent-based modelling.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: By using a spatially explicit computer
   simulation model based on behavioural and ecological data from the field
   vole (Microtus agrestis), we generated a number of repeated time series
   of vole densities whose mean population size and amplitude were
   measured. Subsequently, these time series were subjected to statistical
   autoregressive modelling, to investigate the effects on vole population
   dynamics of making predators more specialised, of altering the breeding
   season, and increasing the level of habitat fragmentation. We found that
   fragmentation as well as the presence of specialist predators are
   necessary for the occurrence of population cycles. Habitat fragmentation
   and predator assembly jointly determined cycle length and amplitude.
   Length of vole breeding season had little impact on the oscillations.
   Significance: There is good agreement between our results and the

Abstract = {{The combined application of organic resources (ORs) and mineral
   fertilizers is increasingly gaining recognition as a viable approach to
   address soil fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We conducted
   a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive and quantitative synthesis of
   conditions under which ORs, N fertilizers, and combined ORs with N
   fertilizers positively or negatively influence Zea mays (maize) yields,
   agronomic N use efficiency and soil organic C (SOC) in SSA. Four OR
   quality classes were assessed; classes I (high quality) and II
   (intermediate quality) had > 2.5\% N while classes III (intermediate
   quality) and IV (low quality) had < 2.5\% N and classes I and III had <
   4\% polyphenol and < 15\% lignin. On the average, yield responses over
   the control were 60\%, 84\% and 114\% following the addition of ORs, N
   fertilizers and ORs + N fertilizers, respectively. There was a general
   increase in yield responses with increasing OR quality and OR-N
   quantity, both when ORs were added alone or with N fertilizers.
   Surprisingly, greater OR residual effects were observed with high
   quality ORs and declined with decreasing OR quality. The greater yield
   responses with ORs + N fertilizers than either resource alone were
   mostly due to extra N added and not improved N utilization efficiency
   because negative interactive effects were, most often, observed when
   combining ORs with N fertilizers. Additionally, their agronomic N use
   efficiency was not different from sole added ORs but lower than N
   fertilizers added alone. Nevertheless, positive interactive effects were
   observed in sandy soils with low quality ORs whereas agronomic use
   efficiency was greater when smaller quantities of N were added in all
   soils. Compared to sole added ORs, yield responses for the combined
   treatment increased with decreasing OR quality and greater yield
   increases were observed in sandy (68\%) than clayey soils (25\%). While
   ORs and ORs + N fertilizer additions increased SOC by at least 12\%
   compared to the control, N fertilizer additions were not different from
   control suggesting that ORs are needed to increase SOC. Thus, the
   addition of ORs will likely improve nutrient storage while crop yields
   are increased and more so for high quality ORs. Furthermore, interactive
   effects are seldom occurring, but agronomic N use efficiency of ORs + N
   fertilizers were greater with low quantities of N added, offering
   potential for increasing crop productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems are being altered on a global scale by the extirpation of top
   predators. The ecological effects of predator removal have been
   investigated widely; however, predator removal can also change natural
   selection acting on prey, resulting in contemporary evolution. Here we
   tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary evolution of
   trophic traits in prey. We utilized a historical introduction experiment
   where Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were relocated from a
   site with predatory fishes to a site lacking predators. To assess the
   trophic consequences of predator release, we linked individual
   morphology (cranial, jaw, and body) to foraging performance. Our results
   show that predator release caused an increase in guppy density and a
   ``sharpening{''} of guppy trophic traits, which enhanced food
   consumption rates. Predator release appears to have shifted natural
   selection away from predator escape ability and towards resource
   acquisition ability. Related diet and mesocosm studies suggest that this
   shift enhances the impact of guppies on lower trophic levels in a
   fashion nuanced by the omnivorous feeding ecology of the species. We
   conclude that extirpation of top predators may commonly select for
   enhanced feeding performance in prey, with important cascading
   consequences for communities and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Classic niche partitioning suggests that coexistence among asymmetric
   competitors is facilitated by differential resource use. Coexistence is
   also possible, however, when a species only has access to resources that
   are shared with a competitor, providing it is the superior competitor on
   that resource (the `included niche'). To test predictions of these two
   coexistence mechanisms, we studied habitat selection of two closely
   related sympatric plant-specialist frogs from Madagascar (Guibemantis
   bicalcaratus and Guibemantis punctatus). Both species live and breed
   only in the water-filled leaf axils of Pandanus plants, and previous
   experiments with their tadpoles demonstrated asymmetric competition. In
   a 3-yr field study, we: (1) monitored the biotic and abiotic conditions
   of 348 plants; (2) surveyed these plants for frogs; (3) undertook a
   mark-recapture study; and (4) conducted an experiment where we
   manipulated the amount of detritus in plants. We identified several
   differences in the conditions of the habitats selected by both species
   (e.g., plant height, canopy cover over the plant, abundance of
   heterospecifics). Co-occurrence was nevertheless common, and G.
   punctatus persisted almost exclusively in plants it shared with G.
   bicalcaratus. As predicted by theory, G. punctatus was the superior
   competitor, at least in the tadpole stage. The inferior competitor (G.
   bicalcaratus) had access to exclusive resources not available to G.
   punctatus, by virtue of a faster developmental rate that permitted
   reproduction in lower quality plants. While there was some evidence of
   weak niche partitioning, we conclude that coexistence in these
   plant-specialist frogs is primarily via an included niche mechanism.}},

Pages = {{531-546}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the relative impacts of top-down vs. bottom-up control of
   ecosystems remains a controversial issue, with debate often focusing on
   the perennial question of how predators affect prey densities. To assess
   predator impacts, we performed a worldwide meta-analysis of field
   experiments in which the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators
   were manipulated and the responses of their terrestrial vertebrate prey
   were measured. Our results show that predation indeed limits prey
   populations, as prey densities change substantially after predator
   manipulations. The main determinant of the result of an experiment was
   the efficiency of predator manipulation. Positive impacts of predator
   manipulation appeared to increase with duration of the experiment for
   non-cyclic prey, while the opposite was true for cyclic prey. In
   addition, predator manipulation showed a large positive impact on cyclic
   prey at low prey densities, but had no obvious impact at peak prey
   densities. As prey population densities generally respond predictably to
   predator manipulations, we suggest that control of introduced vertebrate
   predators can be used to effectively conserve and manage native
   wildlife. However, care should be taken when controlling native
   predators, especially apex species, owing to their importance as strong
   interactors and the biodiversity value of their habitats. We discuss
   gaps in our knowledge of predator-prey relationships and methodological
   issues related to manipulation experiments. An important guideline for
   future studies is that adequate monitoring of predator numbers before
   and during the experiment is the only way to ensure that observed
   responses in prey populations are actually caused by changes in
   predation impacts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{993-1001}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Through their effects on plant communities, herbivores can exert
   strong direct and indirect effects on savanna ecosystems and have the
   potential to create and maintain savanna landscape heterogeneity.
   Throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, periodic creation and abandonment
   of livestock corrals leads to landscape mosaics of long-term ecosystem
   hotspots that attract both cattle and large ungulate wildlife.
   2. The development and maintenance of vegetation in these types of
   hotspots may be controlled in part by herbivory. Cattle and wildlife may
   have different, potentially contrasting effects on plant succession and
   plant-plant interactions. We ask how cattle and wild herbivores affect
   the maintenance and vegetation development of corral-derived landscape
   heterogeneity (0.25-1.0 ha treeless `glades') in Laikipia, Kenya,
   through their effects on long-term successional and short-term
   plant-plant dynamics.
   3. We used the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment to exclude from
   glades different combinations of cattle, large ungulate wildlife (i.e.
   zebras, gazelles and other antelopes), and mega-herbivore wildlife (i.e.
   giraffes and elephants). We first assessed long-term changes in cover of
   the dominant grass species, Cynodon plectostachyus and Pennisetum
   stramineum (the early- and late-dominant species, respectively). We then
   used a neighbour removal experiment to test the effects of different
   herbivores on competition and facilitation between the two glade grass
   species.
   4. In the long-term experiment, we found that large ungulate wildlife
   reinforced landscape heterogeneity over time by helping maintain glades
   in their early C. plectostachyus-dominated form. Cattle and
   mega-herbivore wildlife, on the other hand, appeared to reduce the
   positive effects through forage preference for C. plectostachyus.
   5. In the neighbour removal experiment, we found that each grass species
   benefited from facilitation when it was the preferred forage for the
   dominant grazer. Facilitation of C. plectostachyus by P. stramineum was
   strongest when cattle co-occurred with wildlife, whereas facilitation of
   P. stramineum by C. plectostachyus was strongest when cattle were
   absent.
   6. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that different combinations of
   cattle and wildlife have different effects, largely via contrasting
   forage preferences, on the persistence of landscape heterogeneity in
   this savanna landscape. More generally, we provide evidence for
   contrasting effects of cattle and wildlife on short-term plant
   interactions (facilitation) and successional processes within the
   herbaceous plant community.}},

   coexistence in a three-species community in which any two species alone
   do not co-exist. More specifically, it is known that, when a predator is
   introduced into a community of two competing species, if the predator
   only predates on the strong competitor, it can allow the weak competitor
   to survive, but may drive the strong competitor to extinction through
   over-exploitation. We show that if the weak competitor interferes the

   116 published studies reporting ontogenetic patterns in plant defense
   traits and herbivory. Patterns varied depending on plant life form
   (woody, herbaceous, grass), type of herbivore (insect, mollusk, mammal),
   and type of defense trait (secondary chemistry, physical defense,
   tolerance). In woody plants, chemical defense increased during the
   seedling stage, followed by an increase in physical defenses during the
   vegetative juvenile stage. Mammalian herbivores showed a strong
   preference for mature compared to juvenile tissues in woody plants.
   Herbs experienced a significant increase in secondary chemistry across
   the entire ontogenetic trajectory, although the magnitude of increase
   was greatest during the seedling stage. Correspondingly, mollusks
   preferred young compared to older herbs. Future research investigating
   growth/defense trade-offs, allometry, herbivore selection patterns, and
   ecological costs would shed light on the mechanisms driving the
   ontogenetic patterns observed.}},

Abstract = {{Predation and competition are both strong structuring forces in
   community dynamics, but their relative importance is disputed. In a
   laboratory experiment, we evaluated the relative importance of
   competition and predation from juvenile and adult brown trout,
   respectively, on foraging performance of groups of three stone loaches.
   We observed loach consumption rate, time spent inactive, and aggressive
   interactions between juvenile trout and loach in artificial stream
   sections. The controlled experiments were complemented by examining
   stone loach population densities in natural systems as functions of
   juvenile and adult trout. In the laboratory experiments, increasing
   numbers of competitors decreased prey availability, which ultimately led
   to lower consumption rates for loach. Loach responded to predation risk
   by increasing time being inactive, thereby decreasing consumption rates.
   However, there were no effects of juvenile trout competitors on loach
   consumption rates in treatments with adult trout presence, suggesting no
   additive effect of predation and competition on loach foraging success.
   Partial regressions of loach and trout densities in natural streams
   revealed a positive relationship between juvenile trout and loach, and a
   negative relationship between adult trout and loach. Our laboratory and
   field data thus suggest that predation is a limiting factor for loach
   success, and predator presence could mediate species coexistence at high
   interspecific densities.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists have long studied the effect of predators on prey population

   evolution on predator prey interactions. In experiments conducted over
   12 days (approximately 50 prey generations, but less than one predator
   generation), we measured a decrease in the effect of mosquito larvae
   predators on protozoa prey populations. In a separate set of
   experiments, we found that the presence of predators corresponded with
   evolution of smaller cell size and increased population growth rate. In
   ecological experiments, two situations commonly occur: strong selection

   tested whether the effect of interspecific competition is greater than,

   Meta-analysis of survivorship yielded more significant effects than did

Abstract = {{In food webs heavily influenced by multi-annual population fluctuations
   of key herbivores, predator species may differ in their functional and
   numerical responses as well as their competitive ability. Focusing on
   red and arctic fox in tundra with cyclic populations of rodents as key
   prey, we develop a model to predict how population dynamics of a
   dominant and versatile predator (red fox) impacted long-term growth rate
   of a subdominant and less versatile predator (arctic fox). We compare
   three realistic scenarios of red fox performance: (1) a numerical
   response scenario where red fox acted as a resident rodent specialist
   exhibiting population cycles lagging one year after the rodent cycle,
   (2) an aggregative response scenario where red fox shifted between
   tundra and a nearby ecosystem (i.e. boreal forest) so as to track rodent
   peaks in tundra without delay, and (3) a constant subsidy scenario in
   which the red fox population was stabilized at the same mean density as
   in the other two scenarios. For all three scenarios it is assumed that
   the arctic fox responded numerically as a rodent specialist and that the
   mechanisms of competition is of a interference type for space, in which
   the arctic fox is excluded from the most resource rich patches in
   tundra. Arctic fox is impacted most by the constant subsidy scenario and
   least by the numerical response scenario. The differential effects of
   the scenarios stemmed from cyclic phase-dependent sensitivity to
   competition mediated by changes in temporal mean and variance of
   available prey to the subdominant predator. A general implication from
   our result is that external resource subsidies (prey or habitats),
   monopolized by the dominant competitor, can significantly reduce the
   likelihood for co-existence within the predator guild. In terms of
   conservation of vulnerable arctic fox populations this means that the
   likelihood of extinction increases with increasing amount of subsidies
   (e.g. carcasses of large herbivores or marine resources) in tundra and
   nearby forest areas, since it will act to both increase and stabilize
   populations of red fox.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of species interactions is often strongly influenced by
   variation in the functional traits of the individuals participating. A
   rather large body of work demonstrates that inducible morphological
   plasticity in predators and prey can both influence and be influenced by
   species interaction strength, with important consequences for individual
   fitness. Much of the past research in this area has focused on the
   ecological and evolutionary significance of trait plasticity by studying
   single predator-prey pairs and testing the performance of individuals
   having induced and noninduced phenotypes. This research has thus been
   critical in improving our understanding of the adaptive value of trait
   plasticity and its widespread occurrence across species and community
   types. More recently, researchers have expanded this foundation by
   examining how the complexity of organismal design and community-level
   properties can shape plasticity in functional traits. In addition,
   researchers have begun to merge evolutionary and ecological perspectives
   by linking trait plasticity to community dynamics, with particular
   attention on trait-mediated indirect interactions. Here, we review
   recent studies on inducible morphological plasticity in predators and
   their prey with an emphasis on internal and external constraints and how
   the nature of predator-prey interactions influences the expression of
   inducible phenotypes. In particular, we focus on multiple-trait
   plasticity, flexibility and modification of inducible plasticity, and
   reciprocal plasticity between predator and prey. Based on our arguments
   on these issues, we propose future research directions that should
   better integrate evolutionary and population studies and thus improve
   our understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in predator-prey
   population and community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{1. Plant stress and association with mycorrhizal fungi have been shown

   interactions.
   2. In the present study, the results of a factorial field experiment are
   reported in which the effects of within-trophic-level interactions,
   plant stress, and mycorrhizae on three herbivores of Baccharis
   halimifolia were examined.
   3. Plant stress was increased by adding salt to the soil, and
   availability of mycorrhizal fungi was increased by inoculating plant
   roots. These treatments were applied to plants with either low or high
   densities of a competitor (Trirhabda baccharidis).
   4. For the two leaf miners, Amauromyza maculosa and Liriomyza trifolii,
   increased soil salinity and high densities of the competitor Trirhabda
   baccharidis resulted in significant decreases in density. Neither of
   these treatments affected the gall maker Neolasioptera lathami.
   5. Mycorrhizal fungi increased the densities of all three herbivores,
   possibly by increasing foliar nitrogen levels. For the two leaf miners,
   there was also evidence that mycorrhizae ameliorated the negative

Abstract = {{1. The probability of a transgenic crop establishing a feral population
   outside cultivated areas and possibly outcompeting naturally occurring
   species needs to be assessed to make an ecological risk assessment of
   the transgenic crop.
   2. The interaction between herbivory and competition is thought to
   determine the ecological success of insect-resistant plants, and this
   interaction was investigated in a competition experiment with transgenic
   insect-resistant Bt-Brassica napus, Brassica rapa, Lolium perenne, and
   herbivory from the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae.
   3. As expected, herbivory had a negative effect on the biomass of B.
   rapa at high plant densities. The competitive ability of L. perenne,
   when growing with B. rapa, increased significantly with the level of
   herbivory on B. rapa.
   4. To predict the effect of herbivory in a natural ecosystem, plant
   competition between the two annual Brassica species was analysed in a
   population ecological model. It was concluded that it is probable that
   transgenic Bt-B. napus plants may invade a natural habitat if herbivory
   is sufficiently high and the habitat is suitable for B. napus.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results indicate that it is important

   assessing the ecological risk of insect-resistant genetically modified

Abstract = {{Mediterranean-type ecosystems are increasingly prone to drought stress.
   Herbivory might limit plant functional responses to water shortage. This
   may occur as a result of plant resource depletion or due to the fact
   that leaf damage and drought may elicit opposite phenotypic responses.
   We evaluated the impact of herbivory on plant fitness in the field, and
   the effects of leaf damage on phenotypic plasticity to reduced soil
   moisture in a greenhouse. The study species was Convolvulus demissus, a
   perennial herb endemic to central Chile, which has a Mediterranean-type
   climate. Controlled herbivory by chrysomelid beetles (natural
   herbivores) in the Held had a negative impact on plant fitness,
   estimated as number of fruits. Whereas reduced soil moisture alone did
   not affect seedling survival, damaged seedlings (simulated herbivory)
   had greater mortality when growing under water shortage. The hypothesis
   that herbivory would constrain phenotypic plasticity was supported by
   significant statistical interactions between leaf damage and soil
   moisture, followed by inspections of reaction norms. This was verified
   both overall (all phenotypic traits taken together, MANOVA) and in four
   of the six traits evaluated (ANOVAs). When plants were damaged, the
   reaction norms in response to low soil moisture of water use efficiency,
   root:shoot ratio and xylem water potential showed reduced slopes. While
   undamaged plants increased root biomass in response to low moisture, the
   opposite trend was found for damaged plants. The simultaneous occurrence
   of herbivory and drought events might curtail recruitment in plant
   populations of central Chile and other Mediterranean-type ecosystems due
   to the inability of damaged seedlings to show functional responses to
   low soil moisture. This finding is of ecological significance in view of
   current and projected trends of increased aridity in these ecosystems.

Abstract = {{The loss of a predator from an ecological community can cause large
   changes in community structure and ecosystem processes, or have very
   little consequence for the remaining species and ecosystem.
   Understanding when and why the loss of a predator causes large changes
   in community structure and ecosystem processes is critical for
   understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss. We used
   experimental microbial communities to investigate how the removal of a
   large generalist predator affected the extinction frequency, population
   abundance and total biomass of its prey. We removed this predator in the
   presence or absence of an alternative, more specialist, predator in
   order to determine whether the specialist predator affected the outcome
   of the initial species removal. Removal of the large generalist predator
   altered some species' populations but many were unaffected and no
   secondary extinctions were observed. The specialist predator, though
   rare, altered the response of the prey community to the removal of the
   large generalist predator. In the absence of the specialist predator,
   the effects of the removal were only measurable at the level of
   individual species. However, when the specialist predator was present,
   the removal of the large generalist predator affected the total biomass
   of prey species. The results demonstrate that the effect of species loss
   from high trophic levels may be very context-dependent, as rare species
   can have disproportionately large effects in food webs.}},

Abstract = {{Large predators may affect the hunting efficiency of smaller ones
   directly by decreasing their numbers, or indirectly by altering their

   whether the presence of the Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus affects the
   hunting efficiency of the smallest member of the vole-eating predator
   guild, the least weasel Mustela nivalis, as measured by population
   responses of coexisting prey species, the field vole Microtus agrestis
   and the sibling vole M. levis. We compared the density and survival
   probability of vole populations exposed to no predation, weasel
   predation or combined predation by a weasel and an owl. The combined
   predation of both owl and weasel did not result in obvious changes in
   the density of sibling and field vole populations compared to the
   control populations without predators, while predation by least weasel
   alone decreased the densities of sibling voles and induced a similar
   trend in field vole densities. Survival of field voles was not affected
   by predator treatment while sibling vole survival was lower in predator
   treated populations than in control populations. Our results suggest
   that weasels are intimidated by avian predators, but without changing

Abstract = {{Grazer control of periphyton biomass has been addressed in numerous
   experimental studies in all kinds of aquatic habitats. In this
   meta-analysis, the results of 865 experiments are quantitatively
   synthesized in order to address the following questions: (i) Do lotic,
   lentic, and marine ecosystems differ in their degree of grazer control
   of periphyton biomass? (ii) Which environmental variables affect the
   degree of grazer control? (iii) How much does the result of these
   experiments depend on facets of experimental design? Across all
   ecosystems, the grazers removed on average 59\% of the periphyton
   biomass, with grazing being significantly stronger for laboratory (65\%)
   than for field (56\%) experiments. Neither field nor lab experiments
   showed a significant difference among lotic, lentic, and coastal
   habitats. Among different taxonomic consumer groups, crustaceans
   (amphipods and isopods) and trichopteran larvae removed the highest
   proportion of periphyton biomass. Grazer effects increased with
   increasing algal biomass, with decreasing resource availability and with
   increasing temperature, especially in field experiments. Grazer effects
   also increased with increasing total grazer biomass in field experiments
   but showed the opposite trend in lab experiments, indicating a tendency
   toward overcrowded lab experiments. Other aspects of experimental
   design, such as cage type, size, and duration of the study, strongly
   affected the outcome of the experiments, suggesting that much care has
   to be placed on the choice of experimental design.}},

Abstract = {{Facilitation by nurse plants is one of the most commonly reported

   questions: (1) is there a generalized positive effect of cushions on
   other vascular plant species along the Andes? (2) do different species
   groups (i.e., annuals and perennials, natives and exotics) display
   different association responses to cushions? (3) does the nurse effect

   the overall effect of cushions is positive, however these positive
   effects were more significant amongst exotic plants than in native

   (favouring steady swimming in high-competition scenarios of

Abstract = {{Within a community, the abundance of any given species depends in large
   part on a network of direct and indirect, positive and negative
   interactions with other species, including shared enemies. In
   communities where experimental manipulations are often impossible (e.g.,
   parasite communities), census data can be used to evaluate the strength
   or frequency of positive and negative associations among species. In
   ectoparasite communities, competitive associations can arise because of
   limited space or food, but facilitative associations can also exist if
   one species suppresses host immune defenses. In addition, positive
   associations among parasites could arise merely due to shared
   preferences for the same host, without any interaction going on. We used
   census data from 28 regional surveys of gamasid mites parasitic on small
   mammals throughout the Palaearctic, to assess how the abundance of
   individual mite species is influenced by the abundance and diversity of
   other mite species on the same host. After controlling for several
   confounding variables, the abundance of individual mite species was
   generally positively correlated with the combined abundances of all
   other mite species in the community. This trend was confirmed by
   meta-analysis of the results obtained for separate mite species. In
   contrast, there were generally no consistent relationships between the
   abundance of individual mite species and either the species richness or
   taxonomic diversity of the community in which they occur. These patterns
   were independent of mite feeding mode. Our results indicate either that
   synergistic facilitative interactions among mites increase the host's
   susceptibility to further attacks (e.g., via immunosuppression) and lead
   to different species all having increased abundance on the same host, or
   that certain characteristics make some host species preferred habitats

Abstract = {{1. Intra-specific variation in plant defence traits has been shown to
   profoundly affect herbivore community structure. Here we describe two
   experiments designed to test whether similar effects occur at higher
   trophic levels, by studying pea aphid-natural enemy interactions in a
   disused pasture in southern England.
   2. In the first experiment, the numbers and identity of natural enemies
   attacking different monoclonal pea aphid colonies were recorded in a
   series of assays throughout the period of pea aphid activity.
   3. In the summer assay, there was a significant effect of clone on the
   numbers of aphidophagous hoverfly larvae and the total number of
   non-hoverfly natural enemies recruited. Clone also appeared to influence
   the attack rate suffered by the primary predator in the system, the
   hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, by Diplazon laetatorius, an ichneumonid
   parasitoid. Colonies were generally driven to extinction by hoverfly
   attack, resulting in the recording of low numbers of parasitoids and
   entomopathogens, suggesting intense intra-guild predation.
   4. To further examine the influence of clonal variation on the
   recruitment of natural enemies, a second experiment was performed to
   monitor the temporal dynamics of community development. Colonies were
   destructively sampled every other day and the numbers of natural enemies
   attacking aphid colonies were recorded. These data demonstrated that
   clonal variation influenced the timing, abundance, and identity of
   natural enemies attacking aphid colonies.
   5. Taken together, these data suggest that clonal variation may have a
   significant influence on the patterns of interactions between aphids and
   their natural enemies, and that such effects are likely to affect our
   understanding of the ecology and biological control of these insect
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Intraguild predation occurs when species simultaneously compete for
   resources and interact as predator and prey, which describes the
   interaction between juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus and
   Caribbean reef octopus Octopus briareus in the Florida Keys, USA.
   Octopuses are notorious predators of decapod crustaceans, and their use
   of crevice shelters suggests that they may also compete for shelter with
   their lobster prey. Lobsters use mainly chemical cues to detect and
   avoid octopus, so we hypothesized that the negative association between
   these species may be as much the consequence of avoidance of a superior
   competitor as it is of direct predation. Surveys of lobsters and
   octopuses occupying artificial shelters at 19 hard-bottom sites
   confirmed that lobsters do not share dens with octopuses, and also show
   that lobster and octopus abundances are negatively correlated. Tethering
   experiments on a subset of those sites revealed that predation on
   lobster was indeed higher on sites with more octopuses. Results from
   mesocosm studies indicated that although juvenile lobsters do not attain
   a size refuge from octopus predation, the presence of alternative prey
   and lobster conspecifics reduces the risk of predation on lobster by
   octopus. Mesocosm experiments also showed that octopuses were the
   competitive dominants when shelter was limited. Thus, the negative
   association between lobster and octopus in the field appears to be
   driven by both predation and avoidance of octopus-rich sites by
   lobsters, rather than competition per se. However, crevice shelters
   suitable for juvenile lobster are limited in many hard-bottom areas in
   the Florida Keys, so areas where octopuses are abundant may further
   limit the local accessibility of shelters for juvenile spiny lobsters
   even if the direct effects of predation by octopus are minimal.}},

   determine the coexistence and relative biomass patterns of producer
   species. Combining models of predator-prey and producer-nutrient
   interactions with a structural model of complex food webs, I
   investigated these two aspects in a dynamic food-web model. While
   competitive exclusion leads to persistence of only one producer species
   in 99.7\% of the simulated simple producer communities without
   consumers, embedding the same producer communities in complex food webs
   generally yields producer coexistence. In simple producer communities,
   the producers with the most efficient nutrient-intake rates increase in
   biomass until they competitively exclude inferior producers. In food
   webs, herbivory predominantly reduces the biomass density of those
   producers that dominated in producer communities, which yields a more
   even biomass distribution. In contrast to prior analyses of simple
   modules, this facilitation of producer coexistence by herbivory does not
   require a trade-off between the nutrient-intake efficiency and the
   resistance to herbivory. The local network structure of food webs
   (top-down effects of the number of herbivores and the herbivores'
   maximum consumption rates) and the nutrient supply (bottom-up effect)
   interactively determine the relative biomass densities of the producer
   species. A strong negative feedback loop emerges in food webs: factors
   that increase producer biomasses also increase herbivory, which reduces
   producer biomasses. This negative feedback loop regulates the
   coexistence and biomass patterns of the producers by balancing biomass
   increases of producers and biomass fluxes to herbivores, which prevents
   competitive exclusion.}},

   recently developed factorial meta-analytic techniques to quantify
   potential interactions between UVB radiation and other stressors on
   amphibians. Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by
   1.9-fold compared with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible
   to damage from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were
   more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB
   radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental stressors
   and resulted in greater than additive effects on survival when 2
   stressors were present. Our results suggest that UVB radiation is an
   important stressor in amphibians, particularly in light of potential
   synergisms between UVB and other stressors in amphibian habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Coexistence of host-specific herbivores on plants is believed to be
   governed by interspecific interactions, but few empirical studies have
   systematically unraveled these dynamics. We investigated the role of
   several factors in promoting coexistence among the aphids Aphis nerii,
   Aphis asclepiadis, and Myzocallis asclepiadis that all specialize on
   common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). Competitive exclusion is thought to
   occur when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific
   competition. Consequently, we investigated whether predators,
   mutualists, or resource quality affected the strength of intra- vs.
   interspecific competition among aphids in factorial manipulations of
   competition with exposure to predation, ants, and variable plant
   genotypes in three separate experiments. In the predation X competition
   experiment, predators reduced aphid per capita growth by 66\%, but the
   strength of intra- and interspecific competition did not depend on
   predators. In the ants 3 competition experiment, ants reduced per capita
   growth of A. nerii and M. asclepiadis (neither of which were mutualists
   with ants) by approximately one-half. In so doing, ants ameliorated the
   negative effects of these competitors on ant-tended A. asclepiadis by
   two-thirds, representing a novel benefit of ant - aphid mutualism.
   Nevertheless, ants alone did not explain the persistence of
   competitively inferior A. asclepiadis as, even in the presence of ants,
   interspecific competition remained stronger than intraspecific
   competition. In the plant genotype 3 competition experiment, both A.
   asclepiadis and M. asclepiadis were competitively inferior to A. nerii,
   with the strength of interspeci. c competition exceeding that of
   intraspecific competition by 83\% and 23\%, respectively. Yet these
   effects differed among milkweed genotypes, and there were one or more
   plant genotypes for each aphid species where coexistence was predicted.
   A synthesis of our results shows that predators play little or no role
   in preferentially suppressing competitively dominant A. nerii.
   Nonetheless, A. asclepiadis benefits from ants, and A. asclepiadis and
   M. asclepiadis may escape competitive exclusion by A. nerii on select
   milkweed genotypes. Taken as a whole, the coexistence of three
   host-specific aphid species sharing the same resource was promoted by
   the dual action of ants as antagonists and mutualists and by genetic
   diversity in the plant population itself.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient availability and herbivory control the biomass of primary
   producer communities to varying degrees across ecosystems. Ecological
   theory, individual experiments in many different systems, and
   system-specific quantitative reviews have suggested that (i) bottom-up
   control is pervasive but top-down control is more influential in aquatic
   habitats relative to terrestrial systems and (ii) bottom-up and top-down
   forces are interdependent, with statistical interactions that synergize
   or dampen relative influences on producer biomass. We used simple
   dynamic models to review ecological mechanisms that generate independent
   vs. interactive responses of community-level biomass. We calibrated
   these mechanistic predictions with the metrics of factorial
   meta-analysis and tested their prevalence across freshwater, marine and
   terrestrial ecosystems with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 191
   factorial manipulations of herbivores and nutrients. Our analysis showed
   that producer community biomass increased with fertilization across all
   systems, although increases were greatest in freshwater habitats.
   Herbivore removal generally increased producer biomass in both
   freshwater and marine systems, but effects were inconsistent on land.
   With the exception of marine temperate rocky reef systems that showed
   positive synergism of nutrient enrichment and herbivore removal,
   experimental studies showed limited support for statistical interactions
   between nutrient and herbivory treatments on producer biomass. Top-down
   control of herbivores, compensatory behaviour of multiple herbivore
   guilds, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of interactions, and
   herbivore-mediated nutrient recycling may lower the probability of
   consistent interactive effects on producer biomass. Continuing studies
   should expand the temporal and spatial scales of experiments,
   particularly in understudied terrestrial systems; broaden factorial
   designs to manipulate independently multiple producer resources (e.g.
   nitrogen, phosphorus, light), multiple herbivore taxa or guilds (e.g.
   vertebrates and invertebrates) and multiple trophic levels; and - in
   addition to measuring producer biomass - assess the responses of species
   diversity, community composition and nutrient status.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The abundance and availability of food are critical determininants of
   reproductive success and population dynamics of marine top predators.
   However, recent work has indicated that the quality of the food may also
   be critically important for some marine predators. The `junkfood
   hypothesis' was originally suggested as a potential explanation for a
   dramatic population decline of Stellers sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in
   the Gulf of Alaska. According to the hypothesis, a dietary switch to
   prey of low energy content led to detrimental effects on the population
   of sea lions. A number of observations indicate that the hypothesis is
   relevant for several population parameters. Recent work on piscivorous
   seabirds has provided substantial evidence indicating the relevance of
   this hypothesis in food webs in e.g. the North Pacific, the North Sea
   and the Baltic Sea. The emergence of `junk-food' in these systems may be
   coupled to large scale changes in climatological and oceanographic
   forcing, although predation, fishing and competition provide additional
   plausible hypotheses. It may be possible to predict which kinds of
   animals will be particularly sensitive to food quality; these seem to be
   species with limited ability to carry food loads, with
   energetically-expensive foraging behaviour, and with digestive anatomy
   evolved to minimize mass at the cost of digestive efficiency. This
   review suggests that the junk-food hypothesis is a highly relevant
   factor in relation to sustaining ecosystem resilience, and is an
   important consideration in ecosystem management. Sustaining healthy
   populations of marine top-predators requires an understanding of the
   role of food quality, in addition to food abundance and availability.}},

Abstract = {{Previous experimental studies of competition among foragers rarely
   distinguished between exploitation and interference competition. In many
   systems this separation is experimentally impossible without interfering
   with the natural behavior of the animals. Consequently, these studies
   can only demonstrate the combined effect of interference and
   exploitation on the forager's feeding rate, namely, it usually decreases
   in a decelerating rate as a function of density. We suggest here a
   simple experimental and statistical procedure that facilitates the
   separation of the effects of interference from those of exploitation.
   This procedure includes manipulation of both predator density and the
   foraging experiment duration. The statistical analysis is based on
   multiple linear regression. The working assumption is that exploitation
   can be neglected at the beginning of the foraging experiment because,
   initially, predators do not experience diminishing returns in prey
   capture rates. Using both the results of an individual-based simulation
   and a field experiment dataset of gerbils foraging for seeds in an
   artificial food patch located in the field, we demonstrate that our
   procedure can successfully detect and separate the effect of
   interference from the combined overall effect of competition (i.e.,
   interference plus exploitation).}},

   Evidence from UK Vertebrates}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Controlling vertebrate predators is one of the most
   widespread forms of wildlife management and it continues to cause
   conflict between stakeholders worldwide. It is important for managers
   and policy-makers to make decisions on this issue that are based on the
   best available scientific evidence. Therefore, it is first important to
   understand if there is indeed an impact of vertebrate predators on prey,
   and then to quantify this impact.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the UK as a case study, we use a
   meta-analytical approach to review the available evidence to assess the
   effect of vertebrate predation on animal prey abundance. We find a
   significant effect of predators on prey abundance across our studies. On
   average, there is a 1.6 fold increase in prey abundance in the absence
   of predation. However, we show significant heterogeneity in effect
   sizes, and discuss how the method of predator control, whether the
   predator is native or non-native, and aspects of study design, may be
   potential causes.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results allow some cautious policy
   recommendations to be made regarding the management of predator and prey
   populations. Meta-analysis is an important tool for understanding
   general patterns in the effect of predators on prey abundance across
   studies. Such an approach is especially valuable where management
   decisions need to be made in the absence of site-specific information.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that facilitation between
   plants, when it occurs, is more likely during periods of abiotic stress,

   Therefore, one might expect the relative importance of competition vs.
   facilitation to vary seasonally in ecosystems characterized by
   pronounced dry (abiotically stressful) and wet (benign) seasons.
   Herbivory also varies seasonally and can affect the net outcome of
   plant-plant interactions, but the interactive effects of seasonality and
   herbivory on the competition-facilitation balance are not known. I
   experimentally manipulated neighboring plants and herbivory during wet
   and dry periods for two species of grass: Cynodon plectostachyus and
   Pennisetum stramineum, in the semiarid Laikipia District of Kenya. These
   experiments indicate that Pennisetum was competitively dominant during
   the wet season and that it responded negatively to grazing, especially
   during the dry season. Cynodon showed more complex season- and
   herbivore-dependent responses. Cynodon experienced facilitation that was
   simultaneously dependent on presence of herbivores and on dry season.
   During the wet season Cynodon experienced net competition. These results
   illustrate how herbivory and seasonality can interact in complex ways to
   shift species-species competition-facilitation balance. Additionally,
   because Cynodon and Pennisetum are key players in a local successional
   process, these results indicate that herbivory can affect the direction

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1650-1660}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Direct and indirect interactions between two prey species can strongly
   alter the dynamics of predator-prey systems. Most predators are
   cannibalistic, and as a consequence, even systems with only one predator
   and one prey include two prey types: conspecifics and heterospecifics.
   The effects of the complex direct and indirect interactions that emerge
   in such cannibalistic systems are still poorly understood. This study
   examined how the indirect interaction between conspecific and
   heterospecific prey affects cannibalism and predation rates and how the
   direct interactions between both species indirectly alter the effect of
   the cannibalistic predator. I tested for these effects using larvae of
   the stream salamanders Eurycea cirrigera (prey) and Pseudotriton ruber
   (cannibalistic predator) by manipulating the relative densities of the
   conspecific and heterospecific prey in the presence and absence of the
   predator in experimental streams. The rates of cannibalism and
   heterospecific predation were proportional to the respective densities
   and negatively correlated, indicating a positive indirect interaction
   between conspecific and heterospecific prey, similar to `'apparent
   mutualism.'' Direct interactions between prey species did not alter the
   effect of the predator. Although both types of prey showed a similar
   30\% reduction in night activity and switch in microhabitat use in
   response to the presence of the predator, cannibalism rates were three
   times higher than heterospecific predation rates irrespective of the
   relative densities of the two types of prey. Cumulative predation risks
   differed even more due to the 48\% lower growth rate of conspecific
   prey. Detailed laboratory experiments suggest that the 3: 1 difference
   in cannibalism and predation rate was due to the higher efficiency of
   heterospecific prey in escaping immediate attacks. However, no
   difference was observed when the predator was a closely related
   salamander species, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, indicating that this
   difference is species specific. This demonstrates that cannibalism can
   result in the coupling of predator and prey mortality rates that
   strongly determines the dynamics of predator-prey systems.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variability within cohorts of juvenile organisms can serve as
   the basis for selective mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated
   the important role that predators play in this process but not the
   impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of
   lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult
   competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis;
   family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived
   (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes
   (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus
   Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the
   behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid
   content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three
   treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3)
   predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study
   involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch
   reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident
   fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there
   was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and
   field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship
   between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish; implying
   low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials
   indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition
   selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were
   absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that
   attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional
   chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their
   vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and
   interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and

Abstract = {{Context dependency is deemed to position the outcomes of species
   interactions along a continuum of mutualism to parasitism. Thus, it is
   imperative to understand which factors determine where a particular
   interspecific interaction falls along the continuum. Over the past 20
   years research on the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis has resulted in
   sufficient independent studies to now generalize about the factors and
   mechanisms that affect host response to ectomycorrhizas. Using
   meta-analysis we quantitatively evaluated the role of biotic (partner
   identity and colonization levels of ectomycorrhizal fungi) and abiotic
   (phosphorus levels) factors in determining host biomass, height, and
   shoot : root responses to ectomycorrhizal associations. On average,
   seedlings across multiple host genera increased in total biomass when
   inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi regardless of the identity of the
   fungal associate; host genera differed in the magnitude of response for
   both total biomass and shoot : root ratio. Association with different
   fungal genera modified only host allocation of biomass to shoots and
   roots. Neither level of colonization on inoculated seedlings nor the
   level of contamination on control seedlings relative to colonization
   levels by target fungi on inoculated seedlings was important in
   explaining variation in effect sizes for any growth response. None of
   our proposed factors (identity of partners, colonization level,
   magnitude of contamination, or duration of association) explained
   variation in effect sizes for shoot height, although in general
   seedlings were taller when inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   Phosphorus additions did not influence effect sizes. Although the
   general trend across studies was for a positive response of hosts to
   ectomycorrhizal inoculation, publication bias and methodological issues
   effectively reduce and distort the spectrum on which we evaluate host
   responses to ectomycorrhizal inoculation. Our results indicate that the
   variation in ectomycorrhizal fungi perceived by the host may be of a
   discrete (presence/absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi) rather than
   continuous nature (variation in identity or abundance of ectomycorrhizal
   fungi).}},

   in intraspecific competition and that this pattern of selection was
   dependent on the presence of both herbivores, suggesting that selection
   will depend on the rarity or commonness of these species. These results

Abstract = {{Factors contributing to the evolution of reproductive strategies have
   been of great interest to evolutionary biologists. In tropical
   amphibians predation and competition have been suggested to play a major
   role. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae display a trend towards
   the use of very small pools and increased parental care, particularly in
   the genus Dendrobates. Some species with female parental care,
   asymmetrical biparental care and biparental care, have evolved novel
   behaviors in association with the use very small phytotelmata. It has
   been hypothesized that selection pressure imposed by predation and
   competition favored the use of small phytotelmata, and this, in turn,
   produced selection for trophic egg provisioning to ameliorate the lack
   of available nutrients. To elucidate the ecological factors associated
   with the transition from uniparental male care to biparental care and
   associated changes in social behaviors, we evaluated key behavioral and
   ecological differences between Dendrobates imitator and D. variabilis.
   Dendrobates imitator used significantly smaller phytotelmata in
   different plant species than D. variabilis for tadpole and embryo
   deposition. The parental strategy of D. variabilis was limited to male
   parental care, whereas D. imitator exhibited biparental care. Males and
   females of D. variabilis were observed to have a promiscuous mating
   system with little mate fidelity. This contrasted with D. imitator,
   where paired males and females were observed interacting daily and were
   never observed courting additional mates. Our results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that a key ecological difference between these
   species, involving the size of pools typically used for reproduction, is
   strongly associated with the evolution of biparental care and monogamy
   in D. imitator.}},

Abstract = {{1. I performed a factorial transplant experiment to test the roles of
   plant-plant interactions, herbivory by mammal grazers and resource
   availability for plant performance in two contrasting habitat types in a
   mountain tundra environment.
   2. Three perennial dicot herbs, Solidago virgaurea, Erigeron uniflorus
   and Saussurea alpina, were used as target plants to study the effects of
   neighbour removal and grazer exclusion, and nutrient enrichment and
   liming on plant growth, survival and reproductive success. These
   treatments were replicated in two contrasting habitat types, infertile
   acidic and fertile non-acidic tundra heaths.
   3. The effects of plant-plant interactions on Saussurea varied from
   facilitation in infertile acidic habitats to competition in fertile
   non-acidic habitats and in nutrient-enriched conditions, while the
   overall performance of Saussurea was strongly negatively influenced by
   the presence of grazers, the effects being greater when plants were
   fertilized and in fertile non-acidic heaths. Erigeron performed better
   under nutrient-enriched conditions than in unfertilized plots, when
   neighbours had been removed. Solidago was negatively affected by grazing
   and this impact was greater in nutrient-enriched plots and in non-acidic
   heaths than in acidic heaths and for unfertilized controls. There were
   no interactions between neighbour removal and herbivory in any of the
   three species, indicating that these processes operated independently.
   4. Grazer-preferred tall plants are strongly limited by consumption by
   mammal herbivores in nutrient-enriched conditions and in inherently
   fertile habitats. By contrast, arctic-alpine specialists and species of
   low stature experience increased competition with neighbouring
   vegetation in fertile habitats and in enriched nutrient conditions.
   5. Synthesis. Overall, the results suggest that the strength and
   directions of plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions depend on
   plant species identity and are modified by soil edaphic factors to
   govern vegetation processes in tundra plant communities. These findings
   have important implications for understanding the forces structuring
   vegetation in barren tundra ecosystems under a changing environment.}},

   predation: facilitation of coexistence?}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{6-12}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific competition is usually understood as different species
   competing directly with each other for limited resources. However,
   predators can alter such competitive interactions substantially.
   Predation can promote the coexistence of species in a situation where it
   would otherwise be impossible, for example if a tradeoff between the
   competitive abilities and predation resistance of the prey species
   exists. The field vole Microtus agrestis and the sibling vole M.
   rossiaemeridionalis are sympatric grassland species, which compete for
   the same resources. At the population level sibling voles are suggested
   to be superior competitors to field voles, yet more vulnerable to
   predation. We tested the effects of predation on the two species in 0.5
   ha outdoor enclosures by exposing vole populations to radio-collared
   freely-hunting least weasels Mustela nivalis nivalis for three weeks.
   Lethal and non-lethal impacts of predation limited population densities
   of both species during and after the experimental period, but the effect
   was more pronounced in sibling voles in which population densities
   decreased markedly during the treatment period and even after that.
   Field vole population densities remained stable under weasel predation,
   while densities increased in controls. Survival in both species was
   lower in treatment populations compared to controls, but the effect
   tended to be more pronounced in sibling voles and in females of both
   species. The average mass of adults in both species declined in the
   treatment populations. These results suggest that predation by least
   weasels can limit vole populations locally, even during favourable
   summer conditions, and have extended negative effects on the dynamics of
   vole populations. In addition, predation alleviated interspecific
   competition between the vole species and is, therefore, a potential
   factor enabling the coexistence of them.}},

Abstract = {{Field assays of survival and foraging behavior were used to estimate the

   for two freshwater benthic cottid fishes that (1) opportunistically
   exploit high resource availability, particularly during their early life
   history, and (2) compete for resources at the patch scale in estuaries.
   Both species' spatial occurrence tended to reflect avoidance of a larger
   marine predatory cottid, the Pacific staghorn sculpin Leptocottus
   armatus, but the predator overlapped more with prickly sculpin Cottus
   asper than with coastrange sculpin C. aleuticus. Survival of coastrange
   sculpin was reduced more than threefold in experimental assays that
   exposed juveniles to predation risk, which was statistically consistent
   with the principle of mortality-to-growth ratio (mu/g) minimization. A
   subsequent experiment measured foraging on depletable food patches
   during exposure to the threat of predation risk (from an enclosed
   predator that was prevented from causing lethal effects); juvenile and
   adult coastrange sculpin reduced their foraging effort 20-30\% relative
   to a predator-free situation. Examining the foraging cost of predation
   for both coastrange sculpin and prickly sculpin yielded ambiguous
   results regarding the partitioning of resources and predator avoidance.
   Adults of each species differed in their responses to predation risk,

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Theory suggests that body size is an important factor in determining
   interspecific competition and, ultimately, in structuring ecological
   communities. However, there is a lack of pragmatic studies linking body
   size and interspecific competition to patterns in ecological
   communities. The objective of the present study was to determine the
   effect of body size (mass) on competitive interactions between bird
   pairs and to investigate the influence of food guilds. Point-counts were
   carried out in nine sites every month from November 2002 to November
   2003 in the Cuetzalan Region, Mexico, and we used presence/absence and
   abundance data for the analyses. To calculate the strength of
   competition we used the Angle Frequency Method to extract form factors
   from 20 pairwise interactions. A prototype competition interaction and
   random pairs were also constructed. We used clustering techniques (PCA)
   to calculate the dissimilarity scores (distances, D) of each of the
   pairwise interactions to the prototype competition and random pairs and
   one-way ANOVA to test for differences between the means of the random
   and competitive pairs. The ratio in body mass (lnBM) for each of the
   interacting pairs was calculated, and the association between the lnBM
   ratio and the strength of competition (D) was tested using a Pearson
   product-moment correlation coefficient. To test for the influence of
   foraging guilds we used a univariate general linear model. Our results
   demonstrate a significant negative relationship between bird body mass
   ratio and competition strength - i.e. competition strength increased
   when the body masses of the birds became more similar. We did not find a
   significant influence of foraging guild on the relationship between body
   mass ratio and competition strength. On the basis of these results, we
   suggest that high variation in body sizes amongst sympatric species
   promotes coexistence in communities.}},

Abstract = {{Competition is predicted to affect the expression of inducible defenses,
   but because costs of behavioral and morphological antipredator defenses
   differ along resource gradients, its effects on defenses may depend on
   the traits considered. We tested the predictions from different defense
   models in tadpoles of the common frog Rana temporaria, which exhibit
   both types of defenses. In an outdoor experiment, we exposed the
   tadpoles to nonlethal predators (Aeshna dragonfly larvae) and to a
   gradient of intraspecific competition. Morphological responses did not
   follow any of the expected patterns, since investment in defense was not
   affected by resource level. Instead, tail depth decreased in the absence
   of predators. Behavioral defenses followed a state-dependent model.
   Overall, the defense strategy of the tadpoles revealed a shift from
   morphological and behavioral defenses at low tadpole density to
   morphological defense only at high density. This difference probably
   reflects the different efficiency of the defenses. Hiding is an
   effective means of defense, but it is unsustainable when resources are
   scarce. Morphological responses become more important with increasing
   density to compensate for the increase in behavioral risk-taking. Our
   results indicate that competition can strongly affect reaction norms of

Abstract = {{Recent studies have highlighted the impact of the winter North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) on water temperature, ice conditions, and spring

   meta-analysis techniques to test whether 18 lakes in northern, western,
   and central Europe respond coherently to winter climate forcing, and to
   assess the persistence of the winter climate signal in physical,
   chemical, and biological variables during the year. A meta-analysis
   approach was chosen because we wished to emphasize the overall coherence
   pattern rather than individual lake responses. A particular strength of
   our approach is that time-series from each of the 18 lakes were
   subjected to the same robust statistical analysis covering the same
   23-year period. Although the strongest overall coherence in response to
   the winter NAO was exhibited by lake water temperatures, a strong,
   coherent response was also exhibited by concentrations of soluble
   reactive phosphorus and soluble reactive silicate, most likely as a
   result of the coherent response exhibited by the spring phytoplankton
   bloom. Lake nitrate concentrations showed significant coherence in
   winter. With the exception of the cyanobacterial biomass in summer,
   phytoplankton biomass in all seasons was unrelated to the winter NAO. A
   strong coherence in the abundance of daphnids during spring can most
   likely be attributed to coherence in daphnid phenology. A strong
   coherence in the summer abundance of the cyclopoid copepods may have
   been related to a coherent change in their emergence from resting
   stages. We discuss the complex nature of the potential mechanisms that

Abstract = {{Optimizing techniques of impact and consequence assessment are critical
   when faced with the challenges of reclamation within a damaged or

   evaluate herbivore and competition effects on restored communities. We
   assessed concurrent environmental pressures by means of repeated
   measurements using three common indices of plant performance (biomass,
   shoot extension, and survival) in conjunction with monitoring for number
   and timing of plants eaten. Our design incorporated 24 species,
   representing a range of taxonomic groups and growth forms, planted at
   low and high densities, inside and outside large-scale mammal
   exclosures. We demonstrate that biomass and height measurements are
   correlated (at both the individual and the combined species levels),
   whereas the survival index often showed independent information. Using
   the most conservative measure (survival), we delineate between plant
   deaths attributed to seasonal effects, competition (some facilitation
   was apparent), and herbivory (both compensation and loss of fitness were
   demonstrated). Plant spacing effects depended on the index (response
   variable) and whether we measured individual or combined species. The
   survival index rarely showed competition effects. Due to counter
   facilitation effects, competition was not demonstrated for any index at
   the combined species level. The comparison of the relative order and
   magnitude of plants being eaten against impact identified vulnerable and

   sacrificially to buffer damage in new reclamation systems, whereas
   deterrents may be used around known vulnerable species.}},

Abstract = {{The anuran larval guild is frequently characterised by the
   co-occurrence, with high niche overlap, of distinct species in the same
   pond at variables densities during development. Anuran larvae have
   therefore been widely studied as a model system for competition. Body
   size and activity level are considered the most important factors that
   influence the outcome of competition between tadpoles. As species from
   temporary ponds normally show higher activity levels in order to achieve
   rapid growth and thus reduce the risk of desiccation, these species are
   often considered superior competitors. We designed several laboratory
   experiments to examine the intra- and interspecific effects on growth
   rate, mass at metamorphosis and survival to metamorphosis of six species
   in a Mediterranean area. Body size and activity level were used as
   explanatory covariables to determine competitive ability among species.
   An asymmetric and hierarchical relationship was found among the six
   species. Larger tadpole species were more successful in competitive
   interactions than smaller ones, but no relationship was found between
   activity level and competition effects. Species typically found in
   temporary ponds (Pelodytes punctatus and Bufo calamita) were considered
   poor competitors in contrast with other communities studied. Species
   with low competitive ability can persist by using refuges in which
   competition is reduced (e.g. ephemeral ponds).}},

Abstract = {{Plants engage in multiple, simultaneous interactions with other species;
   some ( enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant
   performance. Moreover, effects of different species may not be
   independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing
   their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and
   negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and
   whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never
   been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant
   - enemy and plant - mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis
   of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a
   mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a
   factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the
   magnitude of ( negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (
   positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other
   species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies
   evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the
   true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are
   the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average
   influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did
   mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages
   mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in
   individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative
   effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall
   effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground
   mutualists ( bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of
   significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for
   diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants
   and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi
   enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the
   greenhouse ( but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance
   more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous
   than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to
   non-crop plants ( suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores
   following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in
   effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation is a global stressor with potentially

   the effects of UVB on aquatic organisms, we used meta-analytic
   techniques to explore the effects of UVB on survival and growth in
   freshwater and marine systems. Based on the large body of literature on
   the effects of UVB in aquatic systems, we predicted that UVB would have
   different effects in different habitats, experimental venues, trophic
   groups and life history stages. Contrary to our predictions, we found an
   overall negative effect of UVB on both survival and growth that crossed
   life histories, trophic groups, habitats and experimental venues. UVB
   had larger negative effects on growth in embryos compared with later
   life history stages. Despite the overall negative effect of UVB, effect
   sizes varied widely. In the survival analyses, no relationship between
   mean effect size and taxonomic groups or levels of exposure to UVB was
   detected. In the growth analyses, a larger negative effect on protozoans
   was observed. Our analyses suggest that the effects of UVB in aquatic
   systems are large and negative but highly variable between organisms.

Abstract = {{Two species, Artemisia frigida Willd. (C-3, semishrub, and dominant on

   treatments were: two nitrogen levels (NO = 0 mg N pot(-1), N1 = 60 mg N
   pot(-1)), two defoliation intensities (removing 60\% of total
   aboveground biomass and no defoliation), and three competitive
   replacement series (monocultures of each species and mixtures at

   adaptive mechanisms of A. frigida regarding the interactive effects of
   herbivory, N, and competition in determining its dominant position on

   tolerance in determining herbivore-induced species replacement in

Abstract = {{Aquatic resource managers are continually faced with construction or

   ultimately alter the physical structure and cover of fish habitat. In
   the absence of clear quantitative guidelines linking the change in
   habitat to fish, resource managers often use the change in habitat area
   as a basis for decisions. To assess the weight of scientific evidence in
   support of management decisions, we summarized both the observational
   and experimental freshwater fish-habitat literature. We then extracted
   data from experimental studies (where possible) for inclusion in a
   meta-analysis, to provide a more rigorous assessment of the published
   results of experimental habitat manipulations. We found relatively
   strong and consistent correlational evidence linking fish and physical
   habitat features, yet inconsistent evidence when narratively reviewing
   the experimental literature. On the whole, decreases in. structural
   habitat complexity are detrimental to fish diversity and can change
   species composition. Increases in structural complexity showed
   increases, decreases, or no measurable changes in species and (or)
   communities. The majority of our meta-analyses resulted in supporting a
   direct link between habitat and fish abundance or biomass, with fish
   biomass responding most strongly to habitat change. Habitat alterations

Abstract = {{Interspecific competition is assumed to generate negative effects on
   coexisting species, possibly including slower population growth and
   lower survival. The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the sibling vole
   (M. rossiaemeridionalis) are sympatric close relatives which compete for
   similar resources. Previous non-experimental studies suggest that the
   smaller sibling vole is a superior competitor, yet more vulnerable to
   predation than the larger field vole. We studied the effects of
   coexistence on population densities, reproductive parameters, and
   survival in these two species by means of experimentation in large,
   predator-free outdoor enclosures. While populations of both species
   reached higher densities in the absence of the other, field voles
   appeared to suffer more from interspecific competition than sibling
   voles. The proportion of young individuals in the population was higher
   in the sibling vole than in the field vole at the end of the experiment.
   The presence of a coexisting species reduced the survival of field
   voles. Sibling voles, on the other hand, appeared to suffer more from
   intraspecific competition than interspecific competition. On a
   population level, the sibling vole seems to be a superior competitor in
   the absence of predators due to better survival and possibly a higher
   reproductive capacity. However, predation probably has a profound
   influence on the interspecific dynamics of these two species indicating
   that in natural surroundings apparent competition (i.e. competition via

Abstract = {{The combined impact of multiple plant parasites on plant performance can
   either be additive (the total damage equals the sum of the individual
   effects) or nonadditive (synergistic or antagonistic damage). Two
   statistical models are available for testing the independent (=additive)
   effects of two factors. Here we suggest that the natural history of the
   plant-parasite system should motivate the choice of a statistical model
   to test for additivity. Using in-field, manipulative experiments, we
   examined the interactions between the herbivorous mite Calacarus
   flagelliseta Fletchmann, De Moraes and Barbosa (Acari: Eriophyidae), the
   fungal pathogen Oidium caricae F. Noack (a powdery mildew), and their
   host plant Carica papaya L. in Hawaii. First, we found that herbivorous
   mites had a moderate negative effect on powdery mildew: when mites were
   absent, powdery mildew colonies were larger and more numerous. Second,
   we showed that each plant parasite, when evaluated alone, significantly
   reduced several measures of plant performance. Third, we found that the
   combined impact of mites and mildew on plant performance is mostly
   additive and, for a few variables, less than additive. Finally, we
   explored compensatory responses and found no evidence for nonlinearities
   in the relationship between plant performance and cumulative parasite
   impact. Plants are almost universally subject to attack by multiple
   herbivores and pathogens; thus a deeper understanding of how multiple
   plant parasites shape each other's population dynamics and plant
   performance is essential to understanding plant-parasite interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pervasive overharvesting of consumers and anthropogenic nutrient loading
   are changing the strengths of top-down and bottom-up forces in
   ecosystems worldwide. Thus, identifying the relative and synergistic
   roles of these forces and how they differ across habitats, ecosystems,

   how communities are structured. We used factorial meta-analysis of 54
   field experiments that orthogonally manipulated herbivore pressure and
   nutrient loading to quantify consumer and nutrient effects on primary
   producers in benthic marine habitats. Across all experiments and
   producer types, herbivory and nutrient enrichment both significantly
   affected primary-producer abundance. They also interacted to create
   greater nutrient enrichment effects in the absence of herbivores,
   suggesting that loss of herbivores produces more dramatic effects of
   nutrient loading. Herbivores consistently had stronger effects than did
   nutrient enrichment for both tropical macroalgae and seagrasses. The
   strong effects of herbivory but limited effects of nutrient enrichment
   on tropical macroalgae suggest that suppression of herbivore populations
   has played a larger role than eutrophication in driving the phase shift
   from coral-to macroalgal-dominated reefs in many areas, especially the
   Caribbean. For temperate macroalgae and benthic microalgae, the effects
   of top-down and bottom-up forces varied as a function of the inherent
   productivity of the ecosystem. For these algal groups, nutrient
   enrichment appeared to have stronger effects in high-vs.
   low-productivity systems, while herbivores exerted a stronger top-down
   effect in low-productivity systems. Effects of herbivores vs. nutrients
   also varied among algal functional groups (crustose algae, upright
   macroalgae, and filamentous algae), within a functional group between
   temperate and tropical systems, and according to the metric used to
   measure producer abundance. These analyses suggest that human alteration
   of food webs and nutrient availability have significant effects on

   communities. We conducted mesocosm and laboratory behavioral experiments
   (1) to test hypotheses, derived from by a previous laboratory study, in
   a semi-natural setting and (2) to formulate new hypotheses regarding
   novel species-pair combinations. Our mesocosm experiments did not
   support a previous hypothesis of predation by Desmognathus fuscus (a
   semi-aquatic species) on Plethodon cinereus (a terrestrial species), but
   did support a prediction that P cinereus would avoid D. fuscus. We
   predicted that behavioral experiments between pairs of semi-aquatic
   species would demonstrate predatory behavior by D. fuscus toward E.
   cirrigera and aggressive behavior by D. ochrophaeus toward Eurycea
   cirrigera; we did not find strong evidence for either predation or
   aggression. This finding was surprising given the similar activity
   patterns and dietary habits of these species. Although we predicted that
   Desmognathus might influence local distributions of heterogeneric
   salamanders through interspecific aggression in a manner similar to that
   seen within this genera, we found that both D. fuscus and D. ochrophaeus
   displayed much less aggression than expected. However, D. juscus, in
   particular, appears to induce avoidance behavior in both P. cinereus and
   E. cirrigera without evidence of predation or excessive aggression,

Abstract = {{Eutrophication and predator additions and extinctions are occurring in

   studies, predator removals in factorial combination with fertilization
   and observed productivity gradients, to assess the role of top-down and
   bottom-up forces in structuring multi-trophic communities and compare
   results from these analyses to those from an extensive database of
   trophic cascade studies. We find that herbivore biomass declines and
   plant biomass increases in the presence of predators, regardless of
   system productivity. In contrast, while plants are increased by
   fertilization, this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in
   either the presence or absence of predators. These patterns are
   consistent among marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems and are
   largely independent of study size and duration. Thus, top-down effects

Abstract = {{Predators affect herbivores directly and indirectly, by consumptive and

   and combined effects of birds(chickadees, nuthatches, warblers) and ants
   (Formica podzolica) on arthropods residing in pine (Pinus ponderosa)
   canopies in a factorial field experiment. Birds and ants removed
   herbivores but simultaneously benefited them by removing predatory
   arthropods. Birds and ants had net negative and positive effects,
   respectively,on the abundance of herbivore prey, supporting the notion
   that vertebrate predators have stronger negative effects on herbivores
   than do arthropod predators. Aphids (ant-tended and untended species)
   constituted three-quarters of herbivore biomass. The effect of birds on
   ant-tended aphids was twice that on untended aphid species or tended
   aphid species without ants. This was not due to there being more
   ant-tended aphids for birds to prey on; tended and untended aphid
   species were in similar abundances in the absence of birds. Instead, the
   effects of birds were strengthened by attributes of the mutualism that
   rendered tended aphids susceptible to predation.
   These dynamics led to nonadditive effects of birds and ants: birds only
   reduced tended aphid species and total herbivore abundances on trees
   with ants, while ants only increased tended aphid species and total
   herbivore abundances in the absence of birds. Consequently, top
   predators in this system only influenced total herbivore abundance when
   they disrupted an ant-aphid mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{We used exclosures to assess 16 plant species for the effects of
   planting density and kangaroo herbivory at two recently rehabilitated
   bauxite mines in eucalypt forests of southwestern Australia. Despite
   significant climate differences the browsing trends at both mines were
   similar. By the first harvest (2 months after establishment) there were
   significant reductions in shoot mass and survival for five species
   exposed to browsing, while plants at high density were 25\% smaller than
   widely spaced plants. By the second harvest (10 months), this increased
   to 7 of the 16 species, while spacing effects diminished. We showed the
   effects of herbivory to be profound, while interactions at the seedling
   stage were minimal. Species with higher levels of protein were not
   favoured, while those highest in tannins, salts and sulfur were usually
   avoided. As with other medium-sized herbivores, plant architecture (leaf
   shape) was a prominent selective agent: in this case, grasses and
   grasslike species were most likely to be selected and adversely
   affected, though some dicots were readily consumed. Browsing
   optimization (benefiting from herbivory) was identified in three native
   legumes with high growth rates. In our study, herbivore choice often
   equated to herbivore impact; however, future planting in rehabilitated
   areas should allow for resilience and compensation by some species. We
   offer suggestions aimed at broad silviculture practices: we showed that
   some species benefit from herbivory and suggest these be identified by
   land managers as they may serve as diversions for nearby rare or

Abstract = {{Species diversity in communities of interacting organisms is thought to

   and how dispersal affects diversity at larger spatial scales. I
   performed meta-analyses on 23 studies comprising 50 experiments that
   manipulated species migration and measured community richness or
   diversity to test three hypotheses: that dispersal increases local
   diversity; that this effect depends on the rate of dispersal,
   specifically, that local diversity should be maximized at intermediate
   dispersal rates or else linearly related to dispersal rate; and that
   regional diversity may be either unaffected or negatively impacted by
   dispersal because dispersal tends to homogenize local communities. I
   found that immigration increased local diversity. Further, in animal
   studies, diversity appears maximized at intermediate dispersal rates but
   not with plant studies; however, more standardized studies are needed.
   Finally, results are ambiguous as to what happens at larger scales, with
   studies finding either declines or no change in regional diversity with

Abstract = {{Competition is one of the most important biotic factors determining the

   interspecific competition in the field. White one pea aphid clone
   followed the pattern set in the laboratory, out-competing the Megoura
   viciae clone, another showed the reverse effect with Megoura viciae
   dominating. These differences appear to be the result of variation in
   early population growth rate between the pea aphid clones, rather than
   predation, although predation did lead to the eventual extinction of
   colonies. We also questioned whether intra- and interspecific
   differences in predator escape behaviour could affect the outcome of
   competition in the field. All three clones responded similarly to the
   presence of foraging hoverfly larvae (Episyrphus balteatus), but the
   Megoura viciae clone dropped from the plant significantly less often in
   response to the presence of a foraging two-spot ladybird (Adalia

Abstract = {{The effects of elevated carbon dioxide on plant-herbivore interactions
   have been summarized in a number of narrative reviews and metaanalyses,
   while accompanying elevation of temperature has not received sufficient
   attention. The goal of our study is to search, by means of metaanalysis,
   for a general pattern in responses of herbivores, and plant
   characteristics important for herbivores, to simultaneous experimental
   increase of carbon dioxide and temperature (ECET) in comparison with
   both ambient conditions and responses to elevated CO2 (EC) and
   temperature (ET) applied separately. Our database includes 42 papers
   describing studies of 31 plant species and seven herbivore species.
   Nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio in plants decreased under both EC
   and ECET treatments, whereas ET had no significant effect.
   Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and phenolics increased in
   EC, decreased in ET and did not change in ECET treatments, whereas
   terpenes did not respond to EC but increased in both ET and ECET; leaf
   toughness increased in both EC and ECET. Responses of defensive
   secondary compounds to treatments differed between woody and green
   tissues as well as between gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Insect
   herbivore performance was adversely affected by EC, favoured by ET, and
   not modified by ECET. Our analysis allowed to distinguish three types of
   relationships between CO2 and temperature elevation: (1) responses to EC
   do not depend on temperature (nitrogen, C/N, leaf toughness, phenolics
   in angiosperm leaves), (2) responses to EC are mitigated by ET (sugars
   and starch, terpenes in needles of gymnosperms, insect performance) and
   (3) effects emerge only under ECET (nitrogen in gymnosperms, and
   phenolics and terpenes in woody tissues). This result indicates that
   conclusions of CO2 elevation studies cannot be directly extrapolated to
   a more realistic climate change scenario. The predicted negative effects
   of CO2 elevation on herbivores are likely to be mitigated by temperature
   increase.}},

Volume = {{94}},

Pages = {{7-16}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1 Using meta-analysis, Maestre et al. (2005, Journal of Ecology, 93,
   748-757) recently rejected the predictions of the stress-gradient
   hypothesis for arid and semi-arid environments in entirety. It was
   concluded that neither positive nor negative effects of neighbours
   increased with abiotic stress and that different theoretical models are
   now needed.
   2 In light of this sweeping conclusion, we re-examined the analytical
   approach and explored the general synthetic power of meta-analysis.
   3 Detailed statistical re-analyses demonstrated that some of the
   meta-analyses of Maestre et al. were robust. However, more rigorous data
   selection criteria, changing gradient lengths between studies and
   covariance in response effects did not support their original
   conclusions. Additionally, application of more rigorous data selection
   criteria did allow us to detect a significant and consistent positive
   effect of neighbours, which suggests that facilitation is important at
   many points along stress gradients.
   4 Careful evaluation of the studies used by Maestre et al. also revealed
   serious limitations. Many studies included in the meta-analyses were not
   conducted along stress gradients, did not identify a stress gradient
   within the study, focused on invasive species or were not peer reviewed.
   Most importantly, however, gradient lengths were not quantified and
   appeared to differ dramatically among studies. This crucial source of
   variation was not accounted for statistically nor in the
   interpretations.
   5 Meta-analyses are useful tools for synthesis and description but are
   inherently limited by the appropriateness of the data selected.
   Unfortunately, in this particular instance, the data available to and
   selected by Maestre et al. did not adequately test the stress-gradient
   hypothesis and cannot thus reject its value for understanding the
   organization of plant communities in arid systems.
   6 The ecological implication of our synthesis is that meta-analytical
   summary statistics may not always tell the whole story. Alternative
   interpretations of differences in effect sizes (or lack thereof) are
   possible because studies will vary in their ability to test specific
   predictions of a hypothesis, and furthermore, a certain level of
   judgement is required to infer the relative importance of certain ideas
   to synthetic progress within a discipline.}},

Abstract = {{Theory and experiments demonstrate that the number of species in a local
   area can determine rates of ecosystem processes, but we know little
   about how the strength of that control compares with other influences or
   how it might vary across ecological gradients. Here I report results of
   a pond mesocosm experiment where consumer (snail) species richness,
   predation intensity, and nutrient availability were crossed in a
   full-factorial design. This design allowed a direct comparison of the
   strength of the different factors on food web properties and ecosystem
   functioning (i.e., system-level fluxes of energy or matter), and an
   evaluation of how the factors may interact.
   Systems with higher snail species richness had greater secondary
   production, consumer biomass, ecosystem respiration, and macrophyte
   stern growth, and lower epiphyton and periphyton biomass. However, snail
   species richness effects on periphyton and epiphyton were context
   dependent; predators reduced the effect of increasing snail richness on
   the biomass of attached algae. Species richness effects were most often
   the result of a biological mechanism (e.g., differential resource use),
   rather than being solely artifacts of the experimental design (e g.,
   sampling effects). The effects of nutrient enrichment and predation were
   mostly predictable from simple food chain models; increases in nutrient
   availability led to increased algal biomass, primary production, and
   snail biomass, while predators decreased snail biomass and indirectly
   augmented algae.
   Snail species richness effects on the biomass of many functional groups
   were as strong or stronger than those of a substantial nutrient
   enrichment or of the addition of a voracious predator (Belostoma
   flumineum). Nutrient enrichment had the most pronounced effects on
   several system-level processes (e.g., primary production,
   sedimentation). Species richness had weaker effects on ecosystem
   properties than on particular functional groups, probably because of
   compensatory responses among different producer functional groups. In
   summary, this experiment suggests that the number of consumer species in
   a system can have large and meaningful effects on the distribution of
   biomass in a food web, and that these effects can depend on ecological
   context.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2847-2859}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The relative roles of competition and predation in demographic density
   dependence are poorly known. A tractable experimental design to
   determine such effects and their interactions for demersal (seafloor
   oriented) fishes and similar sedentary species is cross-factoring
   multiple densities of new recruits with the presence and absence of
   predators. This design allows one to distinguish between
   density-dependent mortality due to competition alone, predation alone,
   or an interaction between the two, especially when supplemental field
   observations are available. To date, 14 species of marine fish have been
   examined with some variant of this design, and for 12 species predation
   was demonstrated to be the sole or major cause of density dependence.
   However, as competition may be slow acting relative to predation, the
   importance of competition can be underestimated in short-term
   experiments. On the Great Barrier Reef, we conducted a long-term field
   experiment in which multiple densities of new recruits of a
   planktivorous damselfish were cross-factored with the presence or
   absence of resident piscivorous fish on patch reefs. During the first
   10,months, no density-dependent mortality was detected, regardless of
   whether resident predators were present or absent. By the end of the
   experiment at 17 months, per capita mortality was strongly density
   dependent and highly compensatory in both predator treatments; all reefs
   ultimately supported nearly the same adult density regardless of
   experimental treatment. Examination of treatment effect sizes suggested
   that competition was the main source of density-dependent mortality,
   with predation being merely a proximate agent of death. We hypothesize
   that predators were ineffective in this system compared with similar
   studies elsewhere because prey density was low relative to ample prey
   refuges provided by highly complex corals. Combined with previous
   studies, these findings indicate that density-dependent mortality in
   demersal marine fishes is often caused by interplay of predation and
   competition, whose roles may be altered by variation in habitat
   complexity and larval supply. These conclusions are relevant to marine
   fisheries models, which typically assume that density dependence is due
   solely to intraspecific competition.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models have predicted that the relative importance of

   abiotic stress, with facilitation being the dominant interaction under
   high abiotic stress conditions. A critical reappraisal of current
   theoretical models is needed because experimental studies both support
   and refute their predictions.
   A quantitative meta-analysis of field and common garden studies
   evaluating the effect of abiotic stress (low vs. high) on the net
   outcome of plant-plant interactions in arid and semi-arid environments
   was performed to evaluate the degree of empirical support for these
   models. We created four separate data sets corresponding to the
   categories of response variables commonly used to measure plant
   performance (survival, density, growth and fecundity).
   The analyses showed that both the selection of the estimator of plant
   performance and the experimental approach followed have a strong
   influence on both the net outcome of plant-plant interactions and the
   effect of abiotic stress on such outcome. The effect of neighbours on
   the survival and growth of target plants was not significant at either
   stress level, but that on the density and fecundity of target plants was
   positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) at the low and high
   abiotic stress level, respectively. Density data showed that the net
   effect of neighbours was positive and negative at low and high abiotic
   stress levels, respectively, whereas other estimators suggested that the
   net effect of neighbours did not differ with stress level. None of our
   meta-analyses indicated that the magnitude of the net effect provided by
   neighbours, whether positive or negative, was higher under high abiotic
   stress conditions, and facilitation does not therefore appear to
   increase in importance with abiotic stress.
   As the predictions of current theoretical models regarding the
   relationship between the net outcome of a plant-plant interaction and
   abiotic stress do not hold in arid and semi-arid environments, different
   models are needed. These should consider different sources of abiotic
   stress separately, and should be valid for performance measurements,
   such as survival, that integrate plant responses over time. The
   incorporation of these features into theoretical models will undoubtedly
   improve their predictive capabilities.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Autotrophic biomass is often regulated by resource supply and consumer
   presence. Most studies on top-down vs. bottom-up control of plant
   biomass focus on nutrients as basal resources, whereas light has
   received considerably less attention.
   Effects of light and nutrients may differ because light represents a
   vertical resource and plant adaptations to acquire light might
   counteract or facilitate consumer effects. I tested the interaction
   between light supply and consumer presence in a meta-analysis of
   experiments that manipulated both these factors factorially and measured
   the biomass of benthic algae (periphyton).
   Both grazer removal and light enhancement had positive effects on algal
   biomass. These two factors showed strong interactions, which exceeded
   previously observed interaction terms between nutrient supply and grazer
   removal. Positive light effects on algal biomass were primarily observed
   in the absence of grazers. Grazer effects became stronger at high light
   supply, which indicated that high light favours algal growth types that
   are easily ingested.
   Further analyses showed that light effects increased with trophic state
   of the habitat and with algal biomass, indicating enhanced importance of
   light limitation and self-shading at high nutrient supply. Grazer
   effects depended on grazer biomass and varied with type of experimental
   manipulation.
   This study implies that light is of similar importance as nutrients in
   resource control of benthic algal biomass. High light levels
   simultaneously enhance consumer control of algal biomass, resulting in
   strong resource vs. consumer interactions. Light competition and
   consumer presence pose a trade-off on algal growth, where growth form
   may distinguish between adaptations to acquire light and to avoid
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-analysis is an important new tool for synthesizing scientific
   knowledge from many previous studies. In fisheries, meta-analyses can be
   used to obtain prior distributions or penalty functions for parameters

   published in a meta-analysis: Type A, the updated results for each stock
   used in the meta-analysis, and Type B, the results that would best
   describe a new stock. Including these results in assessments for the
   individual stocks would result in double use of the data if the
   assessments include the input data used in the meta-analyses, which they
   typically would. To solve this problem, we recommend that an additional
   form of results should be reported in meta-analyses: Type C, the results
   for a new stock obtained by sequentially excluding each stock's data set
   and repeating the meta-analysis. Type C results should be used whenever
   the assessment input data overlap with the meta-analysis input data,

Abstract = {{While theoretical studies of the timing of key switch points in complex
   life cycles such as hatching and metamorphosis have stressed the
   importance of considering multiple stages, most empirical work has
   focused on a single life stage. However, the relationship between the
   fitness components of different life stages may be complex. Ontogenetic
   switch points such as hatching and metamorphosis do not represent new
   beginnings-carryover effects across stages can arise when environmental
   effects on the density and/or traits of early ontogenetic stages
   subsequently alter mortality or growth in later stages. In this study, I
   examine the effects of egg- and larval-stage predators on larval
   performance, size at metamorphosis, and post-metamorphic predation in
   the African tree frog Hyperolius spinigularis. I monitored the density
   and survival of arboreal H. spinigularis clutches in the field to
   estimate how much egg-stage predation reduced the input of tadpoles into
   the pond. I then conducted experiments to determine: (1) how reductions
   in initial larval density due to egg predators affect larval survival
   and mass and age at metamorphosis in the presence and absence of aquatic
   larval predators, dragonfly larvae, and (2) how differences in mass or
   age at metamorphosis arising from predation in the embryonic and larval
   environments affect encounters with post-metamorphic predators, fishing
   spiders. Reduction in larval densities due to egg predation tended to
   increase per capita larval survival, decrease larval duration and
   increase mass at metamorphosis. Larval predators decreased larval
   survival and had density-dependent effects on larval duration and mass
   at metamorphosis. The combined effects of embryonic and larval-stage
   predators increased mass at metamorphosis of survivors by 91\%. Larger
   mass at metamorphosis may have immediate fitness benefits, as larger
   metamorphs had higher survival in encounters with fishing spiders. Thus,
   the effects of predators early in ontogeny can alter predation risk even
   two life stages later.}},

Abstract = {{The trichome dimorphism of Datura wrightii is intriguing because
   glandular trichome production has a high fitness cost. Plants producing
   glandular trichomes ({''}sticky{''} plants) are resistant to many insect
   herbivores that attack plants producing nonglandular trichomes
   ({''}velvety{''} plants). When protected from herbivores, sticky plants
   initially produce fewer seeds than velvety plants but grow to a larger
   size. In a three-year field experiment, we tested the hypothesis that
   sticky plants acquire a competitive advantage through greater vegetative
   growth. In the absence of herbivores, sticky and velvety plants grew to
   similar sizes in their first year, but sticky plants grew larger in the
   second and third years. Seed production of sticky plants was 46-60\%
   less than velvety plants in their first year, and this caused a 13\%
   reduction in their finite rate of increase overall, even though sticky
   plants produced more seeds than velvety plants did in later years. The
   impact of herbivory varied with plant density, and herbivores reduced
   plant fitness more at low plant density than at high plant density. The
   differences in growth associated with trichome morphology occurred too
   late to provide a competitive advantage to sticky plants and probably
   contribute little to the maintenance of D. wrightii's trichome

Abstract = {{In many parts of the world, invasions of woody plants into grassland
   communities have been attributed to an increase in grazing pressure,
   which is hypothesized to reduce competitive interactions between grasses
   and woody seedlings. However, few experimental studies have attempted to
   determine the importance of the effects of grass clipping (= simulated
   grazing) on biotic interactions between plant species in the field. In
   this study we tested the hypothesis that the establishment of Pinus
   sylvestris and Pinus nigra seedlings would vary with grass clipping and
   also soil nutrient level, owing to changes in the nature and intensity
   of biotic interactions. For both Pinus species, we found contrasting
   effects of the herbaceous cover on seedlings according to the life stage
   and the nutrient level. The net effects of the herbaceous cover on
   seedling recruitment rate switched from facilitation to competition with
   soil fertilization. The soil nutrient level also modified the impact of
   grass clipping on pine seedlings. On fertilized soils, clipping
   decreased competition intensity and increased the recruitment of pine
   seedlings. On non-fertilized soils, clipping decreased Pinus sylvestris
   recruitment but did not affect Pinus nigra recruitment. In the study
   area, under natural conditions, the herbaceous cover had a net positive
   effect on seedling recruitment owing to higher emergence. Grass clipping
   should not favour pine invasion in the absence of fertilization, but
   moderate grazing could favour the recruitment of Pinus nigra compared to
   Pinus sylvestris. Although an exotic species, Pinus nigra had a wider
   range of favourable conditions for recruitment than Pinus sylvestris.
   The effects of grazing on woody plant invasion are expected to differ

Abstract = {{We suggest that the ultimate outcome of interactions between native

   Multiple simultaneous interactions may constrain the ability of native
   species to trade fitness components (i.e., reduced growth for reduced
   risk of predation) causing a spiral to extinction. We found evidence for
   five types of interactions between the adults and juveniles of
   introduced western mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis) and the juveniles of
   native least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis). We added ten large ( 23 -
   28 mm) and seven small ( 9 - 13 mm) young-of-the-year (YOY) least chub
   to replicate enclosures with zero, low, and high densities of
   mosquitofish in a desert spring ecosystem. Treatments with mosquitofish
   reduced the average survival of least chub by one-third. No small YOY
   least chub survived in enclosures with high mosquitofish densities. We
   also performed two laboratory experiments to determine mortality to
   predation, aggressiveness, and habitat selection of least chub in the
   presence of mosquitofish. Mean mortality of least chub due to predation
   by large mosquitofish was 69.7\% over a 3-h trial. Least chub were less
   aggressive, selected protected habitats (Potamogeton spp.), and were
   more stationary in the presence of mosquitofish where the dominance
   hierarchy was large mosquitofish>> large least chub approximate to small
   mosquitofish>> small least chub. Least chub juveniles appear to be
   figuratively caught in a vice. Rapid growth to a size refuge could
   reduce the risk of predation, but the simultaneous effects of
   competition decreased least chub growth and prolonged the period when
   juveniles were vulnerable to mosquitofish predation.}},

Abstract = {{Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with
   milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as
   adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes
   require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not
   consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that
   herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to
   grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition
   and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of
   fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the
   consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory,
   growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed
   on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on
   beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using
   full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative
   resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds
   growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered
   10\% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds
   growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to
   grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In
   late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally
   oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and
   without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction
   between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but
   jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing
   season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong
   evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory
   together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual
   effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the
   abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40\%, but only for milkweeds with
   grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the
   production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they
   interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although
   trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of
   competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not
   uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced
   reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground
   biomass) by 20-30\%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net
   interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23\% reduction in
   grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However,
   the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated
   the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational
   effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the
   non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed
   competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many
   traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance
   traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that
   competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection.
   A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf
   trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically
   correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of
   flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were
   most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes.
   Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant
   genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may
   result in diffuse co-evolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I
   present a general model that predicts the conditions in which
   plant-plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Intraguild predation (IGP), defined as killing and eating among
   potential competitors, seems to be a ubiquitous interaction, differing
   from competition or predation. In the present study we assess the
   frequency of IGP among 763 potential intraguild prey and 599 potential
   intraguild predators. Our results indicate that IGP is common in nature,
   reaching frequencies between 58.4 and 86.7\%. A null model suggests that
   IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores,
   omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species)
   have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these
   attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence.
   We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as
   important to the trophic structuring of communities. First, its
   occurrence is not random, rather it is associated with well-defined

Abstract = {{Experimental manipulations of the densities of two larval anurans,
   Pelodytes punctatus and Bufo bufo, showed that these species compete
   asymmetrically in semi-natural conditions. Growth, mass at

   of response to interspecific competition. A mechanistic approach was
   used to collect information on the behaviour of the two species in
   different conditions. The competitive superiority of Pelodytes at
   individual level was correlated with a larger body, faster growth rate,
   increased per capita competitive impact on conspecifics, and greater
   reduction in the availability of trophic and spatial resources. In the
   presence of Pelodytes, Bufo showed slower growth, smaller size at
   metamorphosis and reduced survival. In the interspecific treatments Bufo
   individuals modified their behaviour by increasing activity and use of
   the water column while Pelodytes did not change their foraging activity
   or space use in the aquaria. However, the presence of Bufo resulted in a
   reduced larval period and smaller size at metamorphosis. We hypothesise
   that the presence of Bufo act as a signal of environmental degradation
   and shorten the larval period of Pelodytes, a typical temporal pond
   breeder. The smaller Bufo tadpoles are potentially stronger competitors
   at population level because they use relatively large amounts of energy
   (greater densities and higher metabolic rates). Consequently, they use
   larger proportions of the shared resources than their larger competitor.
   A possible evolutionary response for larger tadpoles is the development
   of interference mechanisms or ``escaping{''} from ephemeral ponds where
   mortality by drying represent a high risk.}},

Abstract = {{Although competition and predation are considered to be among the most
   important biotic processes influencing the distribution and abundance of
   species in space and time, the relative and interactive roles of these
   processes in communities comprised of cyclically fluctuating populations
   of small mammals are not well known. We examined these processes in and
   among populations of field voles, sibling voles, bank voles and common
   shrews in western Finland, using spatially replicated trapping data
   collected four times a year during two vole cycles (1987-1990 and
   1997-1999). Populations of the four species exhibited relatively strong
   interspecific temporal synchrony in their multiannual fluctuations.
   During peak phases, we observed slight deviations from close temporal
   synchrony: field vole densities peaked at least two months earlier than
   those of either sibling voles or bank voles, while densities of common
   shrews peaked even earlier. The growth rates of all four coexisting
   small mammal species were best explained by their own current densities.
   The growth rate of bank vole populations was negatively related to
   increasing densities of field voles in the increase phase of the vole
   cycle. Apart from this, no negative effects of interspecific density,
   direct or delayed, were observed among the vole species. The growth
   rates of common shrew populations were negatively related to increasing
   total rodent (including water voles and harvest mice) densities in the
   peak phase of the vole cycle. Sibling voles appeared not to be
   competitively superior to field voles on a population level, as neither
   of these Microtus voles increased disproportionately in abundance as
   total rodent density increased. We suggest that interspecific
   competition among the vole species may occur, but only briefly, during
   the autumn of peak years, when the total available amount of rodent
   habitat becomes markedly reduced following agricultural practices. Our
   results nonetheless indicate that interspecific competition is not a
   strong determinant of the structure of communities comprised of species
   exhibiting cyclic dynamics. We suggest that external factors, namely
   predation and shortage of food, limit densities of vole populations
   below levels where interspecific competition occurs. Common shrews,
   however, appear to suffer from asymmetric space competition with rodents
   at peak densities of voles; this may be viewed as a synchronizing
   effect.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{156-167}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1 Although substantial theoretical work suggests that competition and
   herbivory should exhibit a wide variety of interactions in their effects
   on plant growth, empirical studies have shown that the predominant
   interactions are simply multiplicative.
   2 To determine both the relative strengths of, and interactions between,
   competition and herbivory, we conducted a field experimental study in a
   native grassland using four focal species: Koeleria macrantha, Coreopsis
   tinctoria, Linum lewisii and Helianthus petiolaris.
   3 The effects of competition and herbivory on plant growth, biomass
   allocation and survival varied among species. When effects were present,
   neighbouring vegetation reduced plant growth and survival, and insect
   herbivores decreased relative biomass allocation to roots and increased
   plant mortality.
   4 Although reduced herbivory caused by insecticide application had
   little direct effects on plant biomass, it did interact with competition
   to affect growth for three of the four species. Herbivory reduced the
   strength of competition experienced by Coreopsis, but increased it in
   Linum. For both Coreopsis and Helianthus, the combined effects of
   herbivory and competition on plant growth were less than expected from a
   simple multiplicative response.
   5 We suggest that interactions were found because we used an
   experimental design that modified insect densities on both neighbours
   and the focal plant, allowing for determination of both direct and
   indirect effects.
   6 We suggest that the antagonistic interactions between competition and
   herbivory may have occurred because herbivores altered the competitive
   environment by harming the neighbouring plants, or because the presence
   of neighbours facilitated focal plant growth by distributing herbivore
   loads over the greater amount of plant biomass available.
   7 Although as an isolated factor competition is more intense in this
   system than insect herbivory, herbivory can alter the strength of
   competitive interactions and thus its importance cannot be determined by
   measuring intensity alone. This result emphasizes that these two
   ecological processes are not truly discrete, and further suggests that
   studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple ecological processes are
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well appreciated that most organisms can alter their

   investigations have documented hundreds of examples of phenotypic
   plasticity, yet most studies have focused on the presence-or absence of
   a single environmental factor. As a result, we know little about how
   organisms respond to-gradients of environmental factors (i.e., threshold
   responses vs. continuous responses), nor do we understand how organisms
   respond to combinations of environmental variables. I examined how
   larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) altered their behavior, morphology,
   and growth in response, to combined gradients of predation and
   competition. Increased predation risk induced lower activity, deeper
   tails, and shorter bodies, which collectively caused slower growth.
   Increased competition caused slower growth which induced higher
   activity, shallower tails, and longer bodies: For both environmental
   gradients, the responses were frequently continuous rather than
   threshold responses. Moreover, predation and competition had interactive
   effects. Responses to predators were always larger under low competition
   than under high competition. Responses to competition were larger under
   low predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in the
   same direction, but larger under high predation risk when predation and
   competition induced traits in opposite directions. The results

   these two sympatric ungulates in Hemis High Altitude National Park,
   Ladakh, India, in an area where the argali established a small new
   population in 1978. Such separation was tested for on the basis of
   expected difference between the species in their proximity to cliffs,
   associated with species-specific anti-predator behaviour. Tibetan argali
   selected habitats away from cliffs while blue sheep selected habitats
   close to cliffs. Blue sheep also selected steep slopes whereas argali

Abstract = {{Different species occupy similar trophic positions in natural
   communities. However, ecologists have often overlooked the consequences
   of this variation for local communities by assuming that species
   occupying similar trophic positions are functionally similar. There have
   been few experimental tests of this important assumption. We tested the
   assumption of functional similarity by comparing the effect of six
   different predators (three fish and three salamander species) on an
   ensemble of larval anuran prey.
   Our experiment identified substantial variation in the impact of
   different predators on a variety of responses. Differences among
   predators in their selection of prey caused the structure of the larval
   anuran ensemble to vary continuously as opposed to producing discrete
   alternative states. Predators also differed in their ability to suppress
   either the total number or biomass of anurans. Thus, performance of
   larval anurans was dependent upon the identity of the predator.
   Moreover, the identity of predators judged similar and their degree of
   similarity depends on the specific response variable. In our study we
   found no predominance of weak or strong interactors, as predators appear
   to be evenly distributed along a gradient of interaction strengths.
   Knowledge of the identity of the species occupying a particular trophic
   position is crucial to predicting the impact of that trophic position on
   a community. Ecologists should not simply assume that species are
   functionally similar. The differing effects of different predators
   suggest that variation in their distribution across complex landscapes
   influences prey number, biomass, population dynamics, distribution, and
   ultimately local and regional species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has indicated the importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) in mediating plant coexistence. Coarse-scale studies compare
   the effects of the presence versus absence of AMF on plant coexistence,
   a phenomenon that is most relevant in early successional ecosystems
   where AMF are patchily distributed. By contrast, fine-scale studies
   investigate interactions that might occur once AMF have developed more
   fully within ecosystems, and most plants come into contact with AMF.
   Whereas coarse-scale effects are well understood, our understanding of
   fine-scale factors is just developing, as a result of investigations
   into AMF-plant specificity, AMF species richness, shared mycelial
   networks, and plant-AMF feedback effects. Further research into these
   areas will provide a better understanding of factors that mediate plant
   species co-existence and, ultimately, the maintenance of biodiversity
   within plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{This review discusses the prevalence and potential for interactive
   effects between herbivory and competition on plant growth and biomass.
   and it is apparent that such effects typically arise when there is a
   mismatch between the spatial scale of herbivore behaviour (food or patch
   choice) and the spatial heterogeneity of the plant community.
   Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two
   approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant
   neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects
   on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed
   herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant
   neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying
   such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced
   somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been
   commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely
   in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence
   of a biased choice of study systems. where studies using the first
   approach have primarily Studied mammalian herbivory while studies using
   the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory.
   Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very
   small-scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible
   interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to
   the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and
   plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life
   history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of
   removal experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms belonging to the green algal genera Desmodesmus and

   that may form typical protective eight-celled colonies to avoid
   mortality from numerous grazers. The morphological response does seem to
   be linked with a herbivorous zooplankton chemical cue, rather than to a
   more general animal excretory product. The grazing activity of small
   sized grazers is reduced, but not of large Daphnia. However, arguments
   are given why grazing protection of colonial Scenedesmus is probably
   more efficient under natural than under carbon/light limited laboratory

Abstract = {{Endemic land snails of the genus Mandarina of the oceanic Bonin Islands
   offer an example of habitat and character divergence among closely
   related species. The molecular phylogenies of Mandarina show that a
   divergence of arboreal, semiarboreal, and ground-dwelling species has
   occurred repeatedly in different times, areas, and lineages. Ecological
   diversification is suggested to be important for the coexistence of
   Mandarina species based on the facts that sympatric species are
   typically highly differentiated ecologically and morphologically, and
   that species occupying similar habitats do not, coexist. The ecological
   diversification of Mandarin,4 has occurred without much genetic
   divergence compared with that of its mainland relatives. This suggests
   that morphological and ecological diversifications are accelerated in
   depauperate environments where there are fewer competitors and
   predators. Although the details of the reproductive isolation mechanisms
   are not understood and further examination is needed, the rapid
   evolution of prezygotic isolation is the main cause of speciation in
   Mandarina. In particular, ecological diversification may be an
   effective. barrier to gene exchange between two species. Because of
   incomplete post-mating isolation and the lower genetic divergence among
   species of Mandarina, breakdowns of reproductive isolation have
   frequently occurred as a result of habitat change. It is important to
   estimate the effect of hybridization on species diversification in
   future studies.}},

Abstract = {{I investigated the separate and joint effects of herbivory (grazing) and
   competition on six grass species and on their distributions across the
   landscape. In a factorial field experiment, cattle were excluded from
   half the subplots, and neighboring plants were removed from half the
   subplots. Transplants of each of the species were planted in plots on
   hillsides and in flat areas, and the entire experiment was replicated in
   two pastures.
   The effects of grazing were negative and were proportional to the
   ungrazed height of each species. In the absence of grazing and
   competition, the flat plots were more favorable than the hillside plots.
   Grazing reversed the relative favorableness of flat and hillside plots,
   most likely because grazing was more intense in the flat plots due to
   cattle preference for flatter ground. The removal of neighboring plants
   always had a positive effect, indicating competition from neighboring
   plants. The relative impact of competition from pre-existing plants was
   generally greater in the flat plots than in the hillside plots.
   The relative impacts of grazing were generally greater in the absence of
   competing plants, and the relative impacts of competition were generally
   greater in the absence of grazing. The most likely explanation for this
   antagonistic interaction between the effects of herbivory and
   competition is an indirect positive effect of grazing that arose from a
   reduction in competition experienced by a target plant due to the
   defoliation of its neighbors.
   The results of this study, when combined with the known distributions of
   the six grass species in this region, indicate that herbivory, rather
   than competition or the physical environment, controls the distribution
   of at least five of the six species across the landscape. For example,
   Schizachyrium scoparium grew well in ungrazed flat subplots but very
   poorly in grazed flat subplots; grazing, got the physical environment or
   competition, accounts for the absence of S. scoparium from most flat
   sites in this region. Competition modulates the effects of herbivory and
   edaphic factors on landscape distributions but does not control the
   distribution of any, of the six species.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient supply and herbivore presence can regulate plant biomass. The
   relative impact of both of these factors, and their interactions, on
   periphyton biomass were examined in a quantitative meta-analysis. A
   literature survey revealed 85 experiments with factorial and replicated
   manipulation of grazer access and nutrient supply. Two measures of
   effect sizes were calculated for each experiment, one based on final
   biomass yields (Hedges' d) and the other on rates (Deltar). Grazers
   significantly reduced periphyton biomass across all experiments, whereas
   nutrient addition significantly increased periphyton biomass. Effect
   sizes were very large for both factors. Thus, periphyton can be viewed
   as highly controlled by top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Grazer
   effects were greater than nutrient effects. This result would be
   expected because nutrient enrichment represents a relative relief from
   nutrient limitation, whereas grazer exclusion represents a categorical
   removal of grazing pressure. Moreover, nutrient uptake and growth
   response are time-lagged, whereas grazer effects are more immediate. The
   assembled data set was used to test for significant impacts of the
   habitat and of the experimental design on the importance of grazers and
   nutrients. Both factors had consistent effects in streams, lakes, and
   coastal environments, although some variation in effect strength was
   found. Background productivity levels also did not affect the main
   effects, but increases in periphyton biomass led to increasing grazer
   effects and decreasing nutrient effects. The interaction between grazing
   and nutrients differed between habitats from different aquatic realms
   and with different productivity. The interaction metric for Hedges' d
   was significantly positive for lakes and coasts, indicating a greater
   impact of nutrients in the absence of herbivores than in their presence.
   No such interaction was found for streams or for mesotrophic habitats.
   Similar trends were evident for Deltar The experimental design
   profoundly affected the effects of grazers and nutrients on periphyton
   biomass, with regard to type of grazer manipulation, type of nutrient
   enrichment, and duration of the experiment. This outcome indicated the
   crucial role of a careful experimental design.}},

Abstract = {{A key question in ecology is which factors control species diversity in

   emphasized the importance of productivity or resource supply, and
   consumers or physical disturbance, respectively. These variables show
   unimodal relationships with diversity when manipulated in
   isolation(4-8). Recent multivariate models(9-10), however, predict that
   these factors interact, such that the disturbance-diversity relationship
   depends on productivity, and vice versa. We tested these models in
   marine food webs, using field manipulations of nutrient resources and
   consumer pressure on rocky shores of contrasting productivity. Here we
   show that the effects of consumers and nutrients on diversity
   consistently depend on each other, and that the direction of their
   effects and peak diversity shift between sites of low and high
   productivity. Factorial meta-analysis of published experiments confirms
   these results across widely varying aquatic communities. Furthermore,
   our experiments demonstrate that these patterns extend to important
   ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and nitrogen retention. This
   suggests that human impacts on nutrient supply(11) and food-web

   were evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining years.
   To determine significance of effects in single years, we calculated
   table-wide probabilities for each stage across multiple years
   (Bonferroni sequential test). Emergent patterns for years were also
   evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining stages.
   3 Survival of seedlings was positively affected by plant size and
   negatively affected by local competition. Survival of juveniles was
   positively affected by plant size, but not by other factors. Survival of
   large stages was not generally affected by any of the factors.
   4 Relative growth rates of all stages were negatively affected by plant
   size; larger plants grew more slowly than smaller plants. Additionally,
   growth rate of juveniles was negatively affected by local competition,

   reproduction.
   5 Next year's inflorescence production was positively affected by plant
   size for both pre-reproductive and reproductive stages. For
   reproductives, it was additionally positively affected by current fruit

   6 Analysis of differences among years showed that herbivory negatively
   affected both survival and growth in 1985, but not in other years,

Abstract = {{1. The effects of global climate change are predicted to be strongest in
   the Arctic. This, as well as the suitability of tundra as a simple model
   ecosystem, has led to many field experiments investigating consequences
   of simulated environmental change.
   2. On the basis of 36 experiments reviewed here, minor light attenuation
   by clouds, small changes in precipitation, and increases in UV-B
   radiation and atmospheric CO(2) concentrations will not affect arctic
   plants in the short term. However, temperature elevation, increases in
   nutrient availability and major decreases in light availability will
   cause an immediate plant-growth response and alter nutrient cycling,
   possibly creating positive feedbacks on plant biomass. The driver of
   future change in arctic vegetation is likely to be increased nutrient
   availability, arising for example from temperature-induced increases in
   mineralization.
   3. Arctic plant species differ widely in their response to environmental
   manipulations. Classification into plant functional types proved largely
   unsatisfactory for generalization of responses and predictions of
   effects.
   4. Nevertheless. a few generalizations and consistent differences
   between PFTs were detected. Responses to fertilization were the
   strongest, particularly in grasses. Shrubs and grasses were most
   responsive to elevated temperature.
   5. Future studies should focus on interactive effects or environmental
   factors, investigate long-term responses to manipulations, and
   incorporate interactions with other trophic levels. With respect to
   plant functional types, a new approach is advocated, which groups
   species according to their responses to environmental manipulations.}},

Volume = {{158}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Many ecologists believe that higher mortality imposed on competing
   species increases the probability that they will coexist. This belief
   has persisted in spite of many theoretical counterarguments. However,
   few of those counterarguments have been based on models having explicit
   representation of the resources for which competition is occurring. This
   article analyzes a series of consumer-resource models of competition for
   nutritionally substitutable renewable resources and determines the range
   of relative resource requirements that allow coexistence. In most cases,
   if consumers are initially efficient at reducing resource densities,
   increasing density-independent mortality widens the range of resource
   requirements of the consumers that allow coexistence, provided the
   increase in mortality is not too great. The coexistence-promoting
   effects of mortality occur because a very efficient consumer species
   usually reduces the diversity of the set of resources it consumes. This
   lessens the extent to which resource utilization differences between
   consumer species can be expressed. Mortality, in this case, increases
   the diversity of resource types, widening the conditions for
   coexistence. However, sufficiently high mortality will usually reduce
   the range of parameters allowing coexistence, in agreement with much
   previous theory. The results presented here also predict maximal
   diversity at intermediate levels of productivity. Previous empirical
   studies and theory are reviewed in light of the theory developed here.}},

Abstract = {{The choice of venue is believed to be a critical decision for ecologists
   conducting experiments, yet the existence of tradeoffs in design and the
   impact of venue on outcome have not been quantitatively evaluated. To
   these ends we reviewed a set of 227 comparisons from 52 studies designed
   to quantify the effect of density on the growth performance of larval
   anurans. We predicted that both design and outcome would be related to
   experimental venue (laboratory, mesocosm, and field). We found that, in
   contrast to our predictions, laboratory experiments did not include more
   factors or yield more precise estimates of responses compared with
   mesocosm and field manipulations. In partial support of our prediction,
   we found that laboratory experiments did utilize somewhat larger numbers
   of replicates and included more levels per factor compared to the
   alternative venues. In addition we found that, as predicted, raising
   tadpoles at higher densities of conspecifics, or in the presence of
   heterospecifics tended to decrease growth. This effect, consistent with
   competition, was strongly dependent on experimental venue. In
   particular. we found that interspecific effects were much stronger in
   mesocosm versus field manipulations. This result is particularly
   relevant because conceptions of amphibian assemblages have included
   interspecific competition as integral to natural patterns of amphibian
   distribution. We conclude that hypothesized tradeoffs among experimental
   venues have not acted in a particularly strong way in shaping the design
   of tadpole density manipulations. However, venue may mediate strong
   effects on the outcome of such experiments. Quantification of such
   methodology based biases will help ecologists more effectively match the
   goals of their experiments with decisions regarding venue.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the
   mean global temperature by 1.0-3.5 degreesC in the next 50-100 years.
   The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in
   temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely
   to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and
   Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International
   Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of
   Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and
   foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In
   this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of
   soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant
   productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites
   representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or
   altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods
   included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented
   and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive
   nighttime warming. Although results from individual sites showed
   considerable variation in response to warming, results from the
   meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2-9 years of
   experimental warming in the range 0.3-6.0 degreesC significantly
   increased soil respiration rates by 20\% (with a 95\% confidence
   interval of 18-22\%), net N mineralization rates by 46\% (with a 95\%
   confidence interval of 30-64\%). and plant productivity by 19\% (with a
   95\% confidence interval of 15-23\%). The response of soil respiration
   to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low
   tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity
   was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and
   grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant
   productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in
   colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three
   processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly
   related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables
   evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the
   relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture,
   site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history,
   etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we
   should be cautious in ``scaling up{''} responses from the plot and site
   level to the landscape and biome level. Overall, ecosystem-warming
   experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of
   terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature.}},
