Title = {{No evidence for trade-offs in plant responses to consumer food web
   manipulations}},

Abstract = {{Plants face a range of trade-offs as they attempt to maximize their
   fitness within a complex web composed of competitors, mutualists, and
   herbivores. In addition to growth-defense and competition-defense
   trade-offs, plants must balance their response to a wide range of
   potential enemies including pathogens and vertebrate and invertebrate
   herbivores. We tested for trade-offs in plant species' responses to
   different types of consumers using a foodweb manipulation experiment in
   which we selectively excluded large vertebrate herbivores and removed
   foliar fungi, soil fungi, and insects from natural and experimentally
   planted grassland communities. We found no evidence for trade-offs in
   the ability of plants to defend themselves against different sets of
   consumers, although plants varied widely in their responses to removal
   of different consumer groups. In addition, the species-level responses
   to consumer removal in monoculture were uncorrelated with each species'
   response in more diverse communities, highlighting the important role of
   local context (e.g., competition and apparent competition) in
   determining the effects of consumers. Plants must balance their
   allocation of energy among a wide variety of tasks including growing,
   competing for limited resources, and defending themselves against an
   array of potential enemies. We found that while plant species differed
   greatly in their response to the removal of consumers, species that were
   susceptible to the effects of one consumer group (e.g., insect
   herbivores) also were susceptible to other consumer groups (e.g., fungal
   pathogens). This suggests that plants differ in their overall allocation
   to defense, but defense investment can proffer protection against a wide
   array of natural enemies. We also found that plant responses to
   consumers depended on the diversity of the surrounding plant community,
   suggesting that among-plant interactions can alter their susceptibility
   to the impacts of consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Insects provide critical ecosystem services to humanity, including
   biological control of pests. Particularly for invasive pests, biological
   control constitutes an environmentally sound and cost-effective
   management option. Following its 2008 invasion of Southeast Asia,
   biological control was implemented against the cassava mealybug
   Phenacoccus manihoti (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) through the
   introduction and subsequent release of the host-specific parasitoid
   Anagyrus lopezi (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) in Thailand. In this study, we
   quantify yield benefits of mealybug biological control in Thailand's
   cassava crop by using two different types of manipulative field trials:
   i.e., `physical exclusion' cage trials and field-level `chemical
   exclusion' assays. In cage trials with two popular cassava varieties,
   root yield and total dry matter (or `biological yield') were a
   respective 4.0-4.2 times and 3.5-3.9 times higher in the presence of
   biological control. Extrapolating results from cage trials, biological
   control thus ensured an approximate yield gain of 5.3-10.0 T/ha for
   either variety. Under chemical exclusion trials, P. manihoti populations
   attained levels of 3266 +/- 1021 cumulative mealybug-days (CMD) over a
   10-month time period, and no longer impact yields. Moreover, under
   effective P. manihoti control, both root yield and biological yield
   increased with season-long CMD measures, and pest management
   interventions-including insecticide sprays-led to notable reductions in
   yield. This study is the first to show how biological control
   effectively downgrades the globally invasive P. manihoti to non-economic
   status and restores yields in Thailand's cassava crop. Our work
   emphasizes the economic value of biological control, reveals how current
   P. manihoti populations do not necessarily cause yield penalties, and
   underlines the central importance of nature-based approaches in
   intensifying global agricultural production.}},

Abstract = {{1. Urban forests provide important ecosystem services to city residents,
   including pollution removal and carbon storage. Climate change and
   urbanization pose multiple threats to these services. However, how these
   threats combine to affect urban trees, and thus how to mitigate their
   effects, remains largely untested because multi-factorial experiments on
   mature trees are impractical.
   2. We used a unique urban warming experiment paired with a laboratory
   chamber experiment to determine how three of the most potentially
   damaging factors associated with global change for urban and rural
   treeswarming, drought, and insect herbivoryaffect growth of Quercus
   phellos (willow oak), the most commonly planted large shade tree in the
   southeastern US, which is known for its resilience to these potential
   stressors.
   3. In a previous study, we found that the urban heat island effect was
   associated with reduced growth of Q.phellos and higher abundance of
   Parthenolecanium scale insects, key pests of oaks in cities. Here, we
   tested the hypothesis that tree water stress is the mechanism for these
   effects of warming. We found evidence that water stress is a major,
   interactive factor reducing urban tree growth, but found no evidence
   that water stress is associated with Parthenolecanium survival or
   abundance. Warming and Parthenolecanium only reduced growth in Q.phellos
   saplings that were simultaneously water stressed.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Across many temperate cities worldwide,
   urban trees grow less than rural trees. Our results point to water
   stress as the most likely driver for this pattern. Importantly, we found
   that water stress both reduces tree growth on its own and exacerbates
   effects of warming and insect pests on tree growth. Therefore,
   management strategies targeted at increasing tree hydration in cities
   may reduce effects of these three key stressors that are expected to
   intensify with further urbanization and climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Insect herbivory decreases plant fitness by constraining plant growth,
   survival and reproductive output. Most studies on the effects of
   herbivory in trees rely on correlational inter-individual comparisons
   and could, thus, be affected by confounding factors linked to both
   herbivory and plant performance. Using the Mediterranean Holm oak
   (Quercus ilex) as a study model, we followed an experimental approach in
   which leaf-feeding insects (mainly Lepidoptera caterpillars) were
   excluded from some shoots in all study trees. Shoots subjected to
   herbivore exclusion exhibited lower defoliation rates and produced more
   acorns than control shoots. Defoliation constrained shoot growth
   throughout the study period, but had no effect on the number of female
   flowers produced per shoot. Acorn production was, however, lower in
   control shoots due to their higher abortion rates, and also to their
   greater mortality risk during summer drought, as shoots with fewer
   leaves were less likely to survive. Plant reaction to herbivory inhibits
   certain physiological pathways involved in plant growth, which, together
   with the effects of physical damage, reduces the amount and efficiency
   of the photosynthetic tissue. This increases their vulnerability to
   environmental stresses, such as water deficit, which limit resource
   assimilation. Defoliation is likely a key factor affecting oak
   regeneration, as it may be a significant source of seed loss prior to
   pre-dispersal acorn predation. Further experimental studies could help
   to elucidate its effects in contrasting environments. In Mediterranean
   regions, the harsher droughts predicted by climate change models could
   worsen the effects of insect herbivory on oak reproductive output.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{699-713}},

Abstract = {{What drives the evolution of increased growth and fecundity in plants
   introduced to a novel range is not well understood.
   We investigate between-range differences in performance for Verbascum
   thapsus, a weedy invader known to grow larger in its introduced than
   native range. Specifically, we question whether adaptation to herbivory
   or climate best explains increased performance of introduced
   populations.
   We grew 14 native and 22 introduced populations of V. thapsus in two
   common garden locations: near Prague, Czech Republic (native range) and
   in Colorado, USA (introduced range). By removing herbivores from half of
   the plants within each garden we tested the prediction of the evolution
   of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis: increased
   performance is driven by an evolutionary shift of resources away from
   defence against herbivory towards growth and reproduction. We then
   investigated whether genetically based clines in performance are
   expressed along climate gradients within both the native and introduced
   ranges.
   On average, seeds produce larger rosettes when collected from the
   introduced vs. native range. While this evolution of increased growth in
   introduced populations in part matches the prediction of EICA, climate,
   not herbivory, best explains this between-range difference.
   Specifically, seeds collected from the native range produce smaller
   rosettes as the climate of origin becomes cooler and drier, while there
   is no cline in performance in rosettes grown from seed collected from
   the introduced range, which are large regardless of climate of origin.
   Thus, a climate-based cline within the native range best explains lower
   average performance of native compared to introduced populations.
   Synthesis. The breakdown in a potentially adaptive cline emphasizes the
   need to more closely investigate the evolutionary processes that shape
   geographic structuring (or its absence) within the introduced range. In
   addition, EICA is not universally applicable to all invasion scenarios,
   and our findings underscore the importance of testing the underlying
   assumptions alongside the predictions of this hypothesis.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{As a compensatory response to herbivory, plants may branch vigorously
   when the growth of dormant meristems is triggered by shoot damage.
   Undamaged plants, on the other hand, often restrain branching, and this
   limitation on growth can be considered a cost of tolerance to herbivory.
   Restrained branching is caused by apical dominance and may,
   alternatively, be associated with fitness benefits in competitive
   environments that favor fast vertical growth. To test these hypotheses
   regarding selection for restrained branching, we compared the
   performance of two subspecies of the biennial grassland herb Gentianella
   campestris; the tall, apically dominant ssp. campestris and the short,
   multi-stemmed ssp. islandica, which shows reduced apical dominance. For
   both subspecies, we manipulated the height of surrounding vegetation
   (competition) and damage intensity in grasslands of differing
   productivity (high, medium, low), and examined population growth rates
   using matrix population models combined with life table response
   experiments. In the absence of damage, ssp. campestris exhibited a
   higher population growth rate than ssp. islandica in the tallest
   vegetation, however with the growth rate still being below one. In the
   medium and low productivity environments where the vegetation was
   shorter, the population growth rate of ssp. islandica was considerably
   higher than that of ssp. campestris as long as no more than about 50\%
   of the plants were damaged. When plants were damaged, the apically
   dominant ssp. campestris showed a positive population growth rate
   (lambda>1) and often overcompensatory seed production in all
   productivity levels, while ssp. islandica showed no compensation and
   therefore the population was predicted to decline (lambda<1). We
   conclude that restrained branching in Gentianella cannot be selected for
   by competition alone, but that episodes of apical damage are required to
   maintain the trait. Furthermore, because of the costs of restrained
   branching, apical dominance should be selected against in grasslands
   where competition and disturbance are low.}},

Abstract = {{The two most pressing challenges to agriculture worldwide are feeding a
   rapidly growing human population and developing more sustainable
   agricultural practices that do not threaten human and ecosystem health.
   We address these challenges through research in plant-herbivore
   interactions, specifically overcompensatory responses in potato to
   herbivore damage. While herbivory is usually detrimental to most crops,
   some potato cultivars can overcompensate and increase crop productivity
   up to two-fold in response to herbivore damage. However, biotic and
   abiotic factors are known to influence compensatory responses. Here we
   tested if compensatory plant responses to herbivory increase
   productivity of potatoes under field conditions along gradients of
   altitude and landscape simplification in 15 different farms. Our results
   suggest that compensatory plant responses could double the mean
   productivity of a potato farm in relation to the productivity of
   undamaged plants. The compensatory response is best predicted by pest
   pressure on a farm with potato plants having the maximum productivity
   when 10\% of the tubers are damaged and decreasing in productivity as
   pest pressure increases. To a lesser extent an interaction between
   altitude and landscape simplification did affect the compensatory
   response, suggesting that abiotic factors play an important role in
   compensation. Our results suggest that overcompensation-based management
   practices could be used to maximize yields on working potato farms.
   Further research is required to determine action thresholds (i.e. the
   damage levels at which pest control needs to be enacted to maximize
   yields and minimize insecticide use) to develop more sustainable ways of
   increasing yields in the future.}},

   Manage. 00:00-00.Starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa), an invasive
   green macroalga in the family Characeae, has recently been found for the
   first time in several Midwestern states. This aquatic invasive species
   is of increasing concern to management agencies, lakeshore property
   owners, and other stakeholders. Starry stonewort has proven difficult to
   control, partly due to its ability to reproduce via bulbils (asexual
   reproductive structures). There has also been a lack of applied research
   addressing the efficacy of current management practices for controlling
   starry stonewort. We examined the effects of mechanical and algaecide
   treatments on starry stonewort biomass, bulbil density, and bulbil
   viability by monitoring treated areas and untreated reference locations
   concurrent with management implemented on Lake Koronis in Minnesota.
   Chelated copper algaecide applications alone and in combination with
   mechanical harvesting significantly reduced starry stonewort biomass,
   but algaecide treatment alone failed to reduce the capacity of starry
   stonewort to regenerate via bulbils. A second, granular algaecide
   application following an initial treatment with liquid algaecide did not
   further reduce biomass in any treated area and was associated with a
   substantial increase in bulbil density in an area treated with algaecide
   alone. Bulbil viability was greatest in the area treated only with
   algaecide (86\%) and an untreated reference area (84\%) and was lowest
   in an area treated with both mechanical harvest and algaecide (70\%).
   The ability of starry stonewort to regenerate and persist following
   algaecide treatment is concerning. Multi-pronged management
   incorporating both chemical and mechanical approaches may improve
   outcomes of starry stonewort control efforts.}},

   The main disturbances in the studied area included branch pruning and
   debarking. Individuals of medium size (20-40 cm) were mostly pruned and
   debarked. The percentages of pruning and debarking were similar at
   population level across the two studied bioclimatic zones (t = -0.04, p

   regardless of the disturbance level. In contrast, in the Sudano-Guinean

   climatic (dryness) and disturbance effects on the establishment and
   recruitment of small trees into the next life stage in tropical savanna
   ecosystems. Good regeneration pattern and the largest individuals were

Abstract = {{Plant compensatory growth responses to herbivory are mediated by soil
   fertility and can have significant feedbacks that affect overall
   ecosystem nutrient cycling. The sedge Eriophorum vaginatum is the
   dominant graminoid in arctic mesic tundra, and is heavily consumed by
   caribou. Here, we compare the principal compensatory growth models in
   explaining the impact of a single episode of simulated caribou grazing
   at two clipping intensities on E. vaginatum total growing season shoot
   production, nitrogen concentrations, and nitrogen pools, over two
   successive years across a soil nitrogen fertilisation gradient. The
   clipping treatments had no effect on shoot production in the growing
   season when they were applied, but substantially reduced growth in the
   following year. Surprisingly, these reductions were consistent across
   all levels of soil nitrogen availability. The Limiting Resource Model
   can best explain this legacy effect on production because it predicts
   alternate compensatory growth responses depending on whether or not the
   herbivory affects availability of the resource that most limits plant
   growth. Accordingly, our results suggest that shoot compensatory growth
   in the year after the clipping was limited by some resource other than
   nitrogen-probably internal carbohydrate reserves or soil phosphorus. The
   clipping treatments initially enhanced shoot nitrogen concentrations and
   pools, but shoot nitrogen pools had decreased by the end of the second
   year due to the legacy effect of reduced shoot production. Finally,
   inflorescence removal substantially stimulated new shoot production in
   both years. Together, our results suggest that herbivory can
   significantly enhance temporal and local spatial heterogeneity in
   graminoid growth and nitrogen cycling.}},

   seedlings were generally resistant to reductions in performance except
   at high frequency, 70\% defoliation. Agropyron cristatum and P. spicata
   displayed similar sensitivity to treatments, mostly in terms of changes
   in AGB and BGB, while P. secunda also experienced increased mortality
   and reduced tillering. If these differences in sensitivity result in
   differential survival, herbivory could impact species postrestoration

Abstract = {{Chinese tallowtree, Triadica sebifera (L.) Small (Euphoriaceae), is one
   of the most aggressive weeds of coastal wetlands and forests of the
   southeastern United States. The lack of specialist herbivores in the
   invaded range may be one of the factors that contribute to the invasive
   nature of this weed. Chinese tallowtree has been the target of a
   classical biological control project since 2006. Several herbivore
   species are being tested for biological control of Chinese tallowtree.
   Concurrently, an adventive herbivore, Caloptilia triadicae Davis
   (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), was found feeding on Chinese tallowtree
   in the southeastern United States in 2004 and now occurs throughout the
   invaded range. Field populations of C. triadicae from two sites caused
   extensive mining damage to the Chinese tallowtree leaves. The greatest
   damage occurred after 30 d of exposure to C. triadicae in the herbivory
   treatment and amounted to about 25-30 leaf mines (early instars) and
   leaf rolls (late instars) per plant. Insecticide-treated plants had
   atmost 5-10 leaf mines and rolls per plant. Despite this difference,
   plant growth in height, number of new branches, and leaves did not
   differ significantly from plants protected from herbivory. Analysis of
   harvested plant results suggested that, in general, herbivory had little
   impact on biomass. However, there was a slight reduction in trunk
   weights in the unrestriced herbivory treatment compared with the
   insecticide-treated plants. Although this study exposed experimental
   plants to only 60 d of herbivory, these results suggested that C.
   triadicae alone will not exert sufficient control of invasive
   populations of Chinese tallowtree. Furthermore, they indicated that
   continued development of biological control agents that target Chinese
   tallowtree are needed.}},

   We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we grew the creeping,

   without aphids. The presence of aphids decreased plant growth less in
   both the high- and the low-nutrient patches in the heterogeneous soil

   treatment. Earthworms did not affect plant growth but survived better in

Abstract = {{Plant tolerance of herbivory, i.e., the ability to recover after damage,
   is an important component of how plants cope with herbivores. Tolerance
   has long been hypothesized to be constrained evolutionarily by plant
   resistance to herbivores, traits that allow plants to cope with
   stressful growing conditions, and traits that influence the timing of
   damage in relation to reproduction. Variation in tolerance and
   resistance can be caused by differences in the identity of the plant
   (e.g., genotype, species, clade) and by the context of the herbivore
   threat (e.g., identity of the herbivore, type of damage it causes,
   abiotic conditions in which the plant is growing). To date, the vast
   majority of studies have explored trade-offs with tolerance within
   species. Here, we test hypotheses of constraints on tolerance using
   comparative approaches in a clade of mustards, emphasizing the variety
   of contexts in which damage is realistically tolerated. We estimated
   tolerance to leaf damage, tolerance to apical clipping at the bolting
   stage - simulating browsing -, and resistance to a specialist and
   generalist lepidopteran herbivore for a group of native mustards, grown
   in field soils unique to each population and in a common potting soil.
   Resistance to herbivores was soil dependent, while surprisingly,
   tolerance was not. Phylogenetic signal in resistance to specialist and
   generalist lepidopteran herbivores was present, but only when plants
   were grown in field soils. Tolerance had low phylogenetic signal.
   Tolerance to leaf damage was unrelated to tolerance to simulated browse.
   We found no evidence for a resistance-tolerance trade-off, and some
   evidence for a soil-dependent positive correlation between tolerance and
   resistance to both herbivores. Drought-tolerant species had poorer
   ability to tolerate browse damage, and earlier flowering species tended
   to be less tolerant to leaf damage. Our results suggest that tolerance
   trades off with traits that allow mostly annual, monocarpic Streptanthus
   (s.l.) to persist in drought-prone conditions but is largely unrelated
   to resistance to herbivores. Our study highlights a need for a new
   framework for tolerance to herbivory that explicitly acknowledges that
   the relationship among tolerance, resistance, and traits that ameliorate
   abiotic stress.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Plants with simple architecture and strong constraints on their growth
   may offer critical insights into how growth strategies affect the
   tolerance of plants to herbivory. Although Dioscorea praehensilis, a
   wild yam of African forests, is perennial, both aerial apparatus and
   tuber are annually renewed. Each year, the tuber produces a single stem
   that climbs from the ground to the forest canopy. This stem bears no
   leaves and no branches until it reaches optimal light conditions. Once
   in the canopy, the plant's production fuels the filling of a new tuber
   before the plant dies back to the ground. We hypothesized that if
   deprived of ant defense, the leafless growth phase is a vulnerable part
   of the cycle, during which a small amount of herbivory entails a high
   cost in terms of loss of opportunity. We compared the growth of stems
   bearing ants or not as well as of intact stems and stems subjected to
   simulated or natural herbivory. Ants reduce herbivory; herbivory delays
   arrival to the canopy and shortens the season of production.
   Artificially prolonging the stem growth to the canopy increased plant
   mortality in the following year and, in surviving plants, reduced the
   stem diameter and likely the underground reserves produced. Tuber size
   is a key variable in plant performance as it affects both the size of
   the aerial apparatus and the duration of its single season of
   production. Aerial apparatus and tuber are thus locked into a cycle of
   reciprocal annual renewal. Costs due to loss of opportunity may play a
   major role in plant tolerance to herbivory, especially when
   architectural constraints interact with ecological conditions to shape
   the plant's growth strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Does light limitation reduce tolerance to leaf damage in the
   annual herb Datura stramonium?
   Hypothesis: Tolerance to leaf damage should be lower under light
   limitation (shade) than under full sunlight, because a reduction in leaf
   area and less exposure to light will limit carbon photo-assimilation and
   plants' ability to maintain fitness.
   Organism: Jimsonweed, Datura stramonium L. (Solanaceae).
   Methods: Damaged and undamaged plants of ten full-sib families (N = 471
   plants) were grown under two different light treatments, full sunlight
   (control) and 35\% light reduction (shade). Total seed number produced
   per plant was used as an estimate of maternal plant fitness. To compare
   the effect of light reduction on tolerance, we used the index of
   tolerance (the difference in seed production between the damaged and
   undamaged treatment of each genetic family). We also evaluated the
   effect of defoliation and light limitation on photosynthetic activity
   (estimated as the chlorophyll content index) and leaf growth
   compensation (i.e. total leaf area, mean area per leaf, and leaf
   number), compensatory characters related to tolerance.
   Conclusions: Light limitation exacerbates the negative effect of leaf
   damage on plant fitness, producing a two-fold average reduction in
   tolerance. Moreover, compensatory growth was lower in the light-limited
   environment. Under high damage and light limitation, the evolution of
   higher tolerance to damage can be highly constrained.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory is a fundamental type of plant-animal interaction that
   presents substantial selection pressure on plants to replace lost
   tissues and to prevent subsequent losses in fitness. Apical herbivory,
   which entails removal or damage to the apical meristem, causes a change
   in plant architecture by disrupting the balance of hormones produced in
   part by the apical meristem. Therefore, for an annual semelparous plant,
   the ability to preserve reproductive success following damage (i.e., to
   tolerate damage) is largely dependent on the plant's pre-damage
   investment into fitness and its regrowth pattern following damage. Using
   multiple regression analyses, we assessed the relationship of
   developmental and architectural traits of experimentally damaged plants
   relative to undamaged plants of 33 Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes that
   display a wide range of undamaged fitness and damage tolerance. Our
   analyses revealed evidence for an evolutionary bet-hedging strategy
   within a subset of genotypes to presumably maximize fitness under
   natural herbivory-genotypes with the greatest seed production when
   undamaged exhibited a significant reduction in seed yield when damaged,
   while genotypes with low undamaged seed production were the only
   genotypes whose seed yield increased when damaged. Patterns of
   endopolyploidy paralleled those of seed production, such that the
   increase in whole-plant ploidy by genome re-replication during
   growth/regrowth contributes to undamaged fitness, damage tolerance, and
   their trade-off. Overall, this study provides the first large-scale
   characterization of A. thaliana regrowth patterns and suggests that
   investment into fitness and endopolyploidy when undamaged may come at a
   cost to tolerance ability once damaged.}},

Abstract = {{The negative effects of turtle-grazing on the vegetative plants parts of

   reproductive frequency and success of Thalassia testudinum under

   Mexican Caribbean. Simulated grazing did not affect the density (flowers
   m(-2)) of female (clipped: 10.9 +/- 4.7SD, control: 8.4 +/- 4.6SD) and
   male flowers (clipped: 20.7 +/- 12.0SD; control 25.6 +/- 16.8SD),
   resulting in a similar seed-set (overall average 55\%) and fruit-set
   (overall average 44\%) in clipped and control plots. Naturally
   turtle-grazed areas did not present significant differences in fruit
   size, fruit-set or seed-set from nearby ungrazed areas. Thus, T.
   testudinum maintained sexual production while grazed, and flowers and
   fruits were not a targeted food source for the green turtles. We
   expected incidental ingestion of the flowers, usually positioned above
   the cropping height of similar to 3 cm. But in the grazed areas, the
   flowers were shorter; being 3.6 cm for female flowers, and 3.3 cm for
   male flowers. Due to these reductions in length, the flowers and fruits
   were closer to the sediment than in ungrazed patches; just below the
   usual grazing level of the turtles. Green turtles can potentially
   eradicate complete meadows. Re-establishment of meadows can only occur
   through recolonization by seeds in floating fruits provided by nearby

   tephritid Eurosta solidaginis. We exposed multiple ramets of 26
   goldenrod genets to nutrient or shade stress and to oviposition by

   varied widely for an induced `hypersensitive' response in which meristem
   cells become necrotic and kill E.solidaginis hatchlings before gall

Abstract = {{Spider mites are destructive arthropod pests on many crops. The

   reproductive performance by suppressing tomato defenses. Tetranychus
   evansi outcompetes T. urticae when infesting the same plant, but it is
   unknown whether this is facilitated by the defenses of the plant.
   We assessed the extent to which a secondary infestation by a competitor
   affects local plant defense responses (phytohormones and defense genes),
   mite gene expression and mite performance.
   We observed that T. evansi switches to hyper-suppression of defenses

   urticae. Jasmonate (JA) and salicylate (SA) defenses were suppressed

   Together, these observations suggest that T. evansi overcompensates its

Abstract = {{To evaluate mechanisms by which defoliation alters grassland
   productivity, we examined mixed grass prairie herbage yields under
   recurring treatments that included hand-clipping of plots over five
   growing seasons at high intensity and low frequency (HILF), low
   intensity and high frequency (UHF), high intensity and high frequency
   (HIHF), or the end of the growing season (deferred control), combined
   with water treatments of ambient rainfall or water addition. The study
   was repeated in a drier upland and mesic lowland range site. Yield was
   assessed as annual accumulated herbage production and, for HILF and
   control treatments in 2012 (year 3), evaluated separately for forbs and
   major graminoids. Temporal changes in the proportional yield during the
   growing season were also examined for the HILF and HIHF treatments.
   Moisture addition increased accumulated herbage, especially in the
   upland, and exacerbated differences among defoliation effects in select
   years. Productivity was greatest in the deferred controls, suggesting no
   treatment led to overcompensation, even with moisture addition. Among
   growing season treatments, yields under HILF exceeded that of the HIHF
   in 6 of 10 different combinations of site and year, particularly early
   in the study and under high moisture. Observed herbage yields suggest
   deferred patches of grassland may boost productivity and limit the
   ability of HILF defoliation to increase production, a pattern magnified
   by a reduction in Pascopyrum smithii in lowlands before mid-July.
   Accumulated herbage yield did respond favorably to HILF defoliation in
   uplands due to increased yields of Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. ex Kunth)
   Lag. ex Griffiths. Overall, these results suggest that any growing
   season defoliation reduces yields, although where defoliation is
   necessary at that time, production may be more likely to be maintained
   under HILF defoliation. More studies examining long-term growth
   responses to defoliation that include variation in vegetation types,
   environmental conditions, and defoliation regime are warranted. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Large grazing animals can have profound impacts on plant communities and
   soil properties; however, these impacts are not always uniform across or
   within regions. The distribution of features such as forage quality,
   water, or shade within a pasture can change the behavior of grazers and
   thus, the impact of their grazing. Where managed livestock grazing has
   been proposed as a conservation tool to enhance or maintain desirable
   plant communities, understanding how spatial variation between tree and
   intertree habitats within a savanna landscape affects the response of
   vegetation and soil properties to grazing will be critical for designing
   management plans for different sites. In this study, we used a
   previously established, long-term livestock grazing experiment in
   California oak {[}Quercus L.] savannas to investigate how the removal of
   grazing affected plant communities and soil characteristics underneath
   and outside of isolated tree canopies. In the oak understory, plant
   community composition shifted in response to livestock removal, largely
   due to a 68-400\% increase in the relative cover of native species.
   Overall plant community composition in open grassland neighboring trees
   changed little in response to livestock grazing removal, yet we did see
   a decrease in species richness and diversity surrounding deciduous oaks
   as the dominance of the exotic annual Bromus diandrus Roth increased.
   The depth of plant litter increased 1 2 cm in both habitat types when
   livestock grazing was absent, along with minor changes in soil carbon,
   nitrogen, and bulk density. These results highlight how different
   habitat patches within savanna landscape can have varying responses to
   grazing removal and illustrate how challenging it will be to use grazing
   as a management tool to enhance the diversity of native species. In the
   oak understory, native species that are tolerant of herbivory may be
   absent or unable to coexist with non-native annual grasses. The
   abundance of understory habitat at a particular site may therefore be an
   important variable predicting the outcome of livestock grazing. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{White-tailed deer are overabundant in much of eastern North America and
   may be suppressing regeneration in some tree species. Herbivory
   initially reduces plant biomass, but it has the potential to stimulate
   compensatory growth. However, stressful environmental conditions may
   reduce recovery from herbivory. Seedlings of Atlantic white cedar,
   Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.) Britton, Sterns \& Poggenb., are frequently
   browsed by white-tailed deer and also experience both flooded and dry
   soils in natural habitats. We conducted a growth chamber experiment to
   test for a potential interaction between simulated deer browsing and
   water availability treatments on seedling height, stem diameter, and
   above-and belowground biomass. Of the 180 study plants, half were
   subjected to an initial clipping treatment, and all plants were then
   exposed to high, intermediate, or low water availability for 90 days. We
   found that, over the short term, seedlings in favorable growing
   conditions could not compensate for lost biomass after simulated
   browsing. Drought reduced shoot biomass, and flooded soils reduced root
   but not shoot growth. Water stress and herbivory did not interact to
   reduce growth more than the effect of each treatment separately. In
   general, the effect of water stress on plant size was greater than the
   effect of simulated herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory is a fundamental process that controls primary producer
   abundance and regulates energy and nutrient flows to higher trophic
   levels. Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on
   herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding
   of the factors that control consumer regulation of vascular plants in
   aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary
   producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and
   functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems
   effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of
   plant-herbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values
   from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first,
   that greater negative changes in plant abundance would be associated
   with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of
   changes in plant abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity.
   We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore
   density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant
   between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects
   associated with smaller reductions in plant abundance than all other
   taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions in plant abundance than
   echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions in plant
   abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a
   positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change in
   plant abundance, with the strongest reductions in plant abundance
   reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater
   herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions in plant
   abundance. Finally, we found that herbivore-plant nativeness was a key
   factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance
   across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of
   invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with
   greater reductions in plant abundance compared with invasive herbivores
   and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native
   herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native
   plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and
   invasive plants were associated with lower reductions in plant abundance
   compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and
   native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of
   herbivore-plant nativeness on changes in plant abundance were reduced at
   high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions in aquatic plant abundance
   are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial
   plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need
   for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plant-herbivore
   interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and
   functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects
   continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological
   dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores, competitors, and predators can inhibit biological invasions
   ({''}biotic resistance{''} sensu Elton 1959), while disturbance
   typically promotes biological invasions. Although biotic resistance and
   disturbance are often considered separately in the invasion literature,
   these two forces may be linked. One mechanism by which disturbance may
   facilitate biological invasions is by decreasing the effectiveness of
   biotic resistance. The effects of both disturbance and biotic resistance
   may vary across invading genotypes, and genetic variation in the
   invasive propagule pool may increase the likelihood that some genotypes
   can overcome biotic resistance or take greater advantage of disturbance.
   We conducted an experimental field trial in which we manipulated soil
   disturbance (thatch removal and loosening soil) and the presence of
   insect herbivores and examined their effects on the invasion success of
   44 Medicago polymorpha genotypes. As expected, insecticide reduced leaf
   damage and increased Medicago fecundity, suggesting that insect
   herbivores in this system provide some biotic resistance. Soil
   disturbance increased Medicago fecundity, but did not alter the
   effectiveness of biotic resistance by insect herbivores. We found
   significant genetic variation in Medicago in response to disturbance,
   but not in response to insect herbivores. These results suggest that the
   ability of Medicago to invade particular habitats depends on the amount
   of insect herbivory, the history of disturbance in the habitat, and how
   the specific genotypes in the invader pool respond to these factors.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Plant tolerance to herbivory is contingent on multiple traits and
   adaptive mechanisms, which makes it a complex response with ecological
   implications. In plants with longterm belowground storage, allocation of
   biomass to inaccessible parts belowground in response to folivory is a
   wellrecognized tolerance mechanism. In temperate regions, spring growth
   from buried rootstock is common among winter deciduous plants and is
   often followed by regrowth after defoliation, both of which draws
   resources from the stored reserves. We developed a mathematical model to
   analyze this tolerance response in a winter deciduous plant with
   long-term belowground biomass when it is defoliated by a specialist
   insect folivore. The model explores how three closely associated
   traits-(1) belowground biomass allocation to roots, (2) spring
   utilization of stored reserves, and (3) post-defoliation regrowth
   capacity-modulate the persistence and dynamics of the plant and
   herbivore populations. Model results show that allocation to belowground
   storage is not only a critical component of tolerance but also
   influences the herbivore population dynamics in ways that depend on how
   and when plant biomass is allocated and used. Low belowground biomass
   allocation and high storage utilization combined with poor
   photosynthetic growth caused extirpation of the plant population by the
   defoliating insects. Stable coexistence of the plant at low biomass
   along with its specialist insect required a moderate amount of
   post-herbivory belowground allocation. High values of belowground
   biomass allocation, storage utilization, and photosynthetic growth
   resulted in sustained cycles of the herbivore and plant populations.
   Interestingly, utilization of stored reserves had conflicting influence
   on above and belowground biomass, and strongly affected herbivore
   population dynamics. Our model thus highlights the complexity of
   tolerance response when it involves multiple traits and mechanisms as
   evinced by winter deciduous plants. We close by discussing the
   implications of our findings for the contributions of defoliating
   insects to biocontrol programs.}},

   was not weakened, using soil nutrients more effectively. Mineral

Abstract = {{A better understanding of plant-herbivore relationships should integrate
   negative and positive effects of consumers on plant fitness. We studied
   the effect of a major insect herbivore (leaf-cutting ants, LCA) on plant
   fitness in several species of Monte Desert, assessing both the direct
   negative effect of ant defoliation and the indirect positive role of
   ants as soil improvers. To estimate the negative and positive effects on
   plants, we sampled 7000 plant fragments carried by the ants and analyzed
   the nutrient contents of refuse dumps in 15 ant nests. We estimated
   plant fitness measuring similar to 10,000 flowers and similar to 3600
   fruits of 122 individuals from 7 of the most common plant species within
   the ant foraging area. First, we compared the fitness between plants
   growing on the nutrient-rich refuse dumps and co-specifics on adjacent
   non-nest soils. Second, using hierarchical confirmatory path analysis
   model, we analyzed how herbivory and nutrient content of refuse dumps
   affected plant fitness. We found that the fitness of plants growing on
   refuse dumps (a) was similar than those growing on adjacent non-nest
   soils, and (b) was unaffected by ant harvesting or by increments in
   nutrient content in a consistent way. In this dry habitat, the effect of
   LCA on plant fitness was complex and species-dependent. To explain this

   limited plant response to soil nutrients due to water stress and the
   potential high abundance plant consumers on ant refuse dumps. Our
   results illustrate the complexity of herbivore-plant interactions

Abstract = {{1. Plants have developed a variety of defence strategies against
   herbivores. One possible strategy is the induced production of
   metabolites following herbivore attack. Plant-associated micro-organisms
   can be the source of such defensive compounds. For example, cool-season
   grasses can be associated with systemic endophytic fungi of the genus
   Epichloe, which produce herbivore-toxic alkaloids.
   2. In a controlled common garden approach, we tested the hypothesis that
   different types of herbivory induce endophyte growth and increase the
   endophyte-mediated production of three bioactive alkaloids which can
   deter or toxify herbivores. During 18 weeks, we analysed biweekly
   endophyte and alkaloid concentrations in the grass Lolium perenne
   infected with the endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The
   experiment was conducted throughout the field season and compared three
   different herbivore treatments to the control treatment (herbivory
   exclosure).
   3. We showed that the concentration of the vertebrate toxic alkaloid
   lolitrem B increased following clipping (a simulation of grazing
   herbivores), while the insect deterring alkaloid peramine increased
   following locust herbivory (biting-chewing herbivores). The endophyte
   concentration increased slightly following clipping (P = 0.09). Sap
   sucking aphids altered neither endophyte nor alkaloid concentrations.
   4. Our study provides evidence for an herbivore-specific induction of
   endophyte-mediated responses following herbivore attack on its host
   grass. Our results suggest that the grass-endophyte symbiosis involves a
   close chemical crosstalk between the interacting partners.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed a theoretical framework to analyze the
   provincial differences in eco-compensation and selected appropriate
   measurement methods to investigate these differences in the operation of
   the eco-compensation framework. Via the use of the coefficient of
   variation, Atkinson index, and Gini coefficient, we investigated the
   overall differences in Chinese provincial eco-compensation time series
   data from 2004 to 2014 and studied the driving mechanism underlying
   these differences. The results showed that: (1) The provincial
   eco-compensation standard has geographical features. For example, the
   provinces crossed by the ``HU Huanyong Line{''}, or located to its
   northwestern side, have obtained extensive eco-compensation. (2) There
   was a trend for differences in eco-compensation to increase over time,
   but with some fluctuations in 2006, 2009, and 2014 as shown by the
   coefficient of variation, in 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, and 2014 as shown
   by the Gini coefficient, and in 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012 as shown by
   the Atkinson index. (3) Time series curves indicated that while the
   signals from the three metrics (coefficient of variation, Atkinson
   index, and Gini coefficient) differ in a short-term analysis, they show
   the same tendency in the longer term. The results indicate that it is
   necessary to evaluate the differences in eco-compensation at the
   provincial level over a long period of time. (4) Via the calculation of
   the virtual Gini coefficient, we found that among the factors that
   influence provincial differences in eco-compensation, the economic value
   of eco-resources played the decisive role, explaining more than 73\% of
   the difference. The cost of environmental pollution abatement was the
   second most important factor, accounting for more than 19\% of the
   difference. The input to environmental pollution abatement had the least
   influence, accounting for less than 8\% of the difference. The results
   agreed with those obtained from other studies, and could be used as a

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{The success of sustainable crop production depends on our ability to
   select or create varieties that can allocate resources to both growth
   and defence. However, breeding efforts have emphasized increases in
   yields but have partially neglected defence traits against pests.
   Estimating the costs of multiple defences against tuber herbivores and
   the tradeoffs among them, as well as understanding the relationship
   between yield and multiple defences is still unknown but relevant to
   both basic and applied ecology. Using twenty commercial potato varieties
   available in Colombia and the tuber herbivore Tecia solanivora, we
   tested whether high yielding varieties show a reduction in three types
   of defence: constitutive and induced resistance, as well as tolerance.
   Specifically, we determined (1) the costs in terms of yield of all three
   defences, (2) the possible tradeoffs among them, and (3) if oviposition
   preference was related to the expression of these defences. We detected
   no costs in terms of yield of constitutive and induced resistance to
   tuber damage. We did, however, find evidence of costs of being able to
   tolerate tuber herbivory. While we found no tradeoffs among any of the
   estimated defences, there was a positive correlation between aboveground
   compensatory growth and tolerance in terms of tuber production,
   suggesting that after damage there are no shifts in the allocation of
   resources from aboveground to belowground biomass. Finally, we found
   that females laid more eggs on those varieties with the lowest level of
   constitutive resistance. In conclusion our findings suggest that in
   potatoes, breeding for higher yields has not caused any reduction in
   constitutive or induced resistance to tuber damage. This is not the case
   for tolerance where those varieties with higher yields are also less
   likely to tolerate tuber damage. Given the high incidence of tuber pests
   in Colombia, selecting for higher tolerance could allow for high
   productivity in the presence of herbivores. Finding mechanisms to
   decouple the tolerance response from yield should be a new priority in
   potato breeding in Colombia to guarantee a higher yield in both the
   presence and absence of herbivores.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Grasses (Poaceae) are the fifth-largest plant family by species and
   their uses for crops, forage, fiber, and fuel make them the most
   economically important. In grasslands, which broadly-defined cover 40\%
   of the Earth's terrestrial surface outside of Greenland and Antarctica,
   40-60\% of net primary productivity and 7098\% of invertebrate biomass
   occurs belowground, providing extensive scope for interactions between
   roots and rhizosphere invertebrates. Grasses invest 50-70\% of fixed
   carbon into root construction, which suggests roots are high value
   tissues that should be defended from herbivores, but we know relatively
   little about such defenses. In this article, we identify candidate grass
   root defenses, including physical (tough) and chemical (toxic)
   resistance traits, together with indirect defenses involving recruitment
   of root herbivores' natural enemies. We draw on relevant literature to
   establish whether these defenses are present in grasses, and
   specifically in grass roots, and which herbivores of grasses are
   affected by these defenses. Physical defenses could include structural
   macro-molecules such as lignin, cellulose, suberin, and callose in
   addition to silica and calcium oxalate. Root hairs and rhizosheaths, a
   structural adaptation unique to grasses, might also play defensive
   roles. To date, only lignin and silica have been shown to negatively
   affect root herbivores. In terms of chemical resistance traits, nitrate,
   oxalic acid, terpenoids, alkaloids, amino acids, cyanogenic glycosides,
   benzoxazinoids, phenolics, and proteinase inhibitors have the potential
   to negatively affect grass root herbivores. Several good examples
   demonstrate the existence of indirect defenses in grass roots, including
   maize, which can recruit entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) via emission
   of (E)-beta-caryophyllene, and similar defenses are likely to be common.
   In producing this review, we aimed to equip researchers with candidate
   root defenses for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Although insect herbivory can modify subsequent quantity and quality of
   their host plants, change in plant quantity following herbivory has
   received less attention than plant quality. In particular, little is
   known about how previous herbivore damage determines plant growth and
   biomass in an insect species-specific manner. We explored whether
   herbivore species-specific food demand influences plant growth and
   biomass. To do this, we conducted a series of experiments and field
   survey using two specialist butterflies, Sericinus montela and
   Atrophaneura alcinous, and their host plant, Aristolochia debilis. It is
   known that A. alcinous larva requires four times more food resources to
   fulfill its development than S. montela larva. Despite that A. alcinous
   larvae imposed greater damage on plants than S. montela larvae, plant
   growth did not differ due to herbivory by these species both in single
   and multiple herbivory events. On the other hand, total aboveground
   biomass of the plants was reduced more by A. alcinous than S. montela
   feeding regardless of the number of herbivory events. Feeding on plants
   with a history of previous herbivory neither decreased nor increased
   larval growth. Our results suggest that food demand of the two butterfly
   species determined subsequent plant biomass, although the plant response
   may depend on tolerance of the host plant (i.e., ability to compensate
   for herbivore damage). Such difference in the effects of different
   herbivore species on host plant biomass is more likely to occur than
   previously thought, because food demand differs in most herbivore
   species sharing a host plant.}},

Abstract = {{The susceptibility to pests and pathogens is frequently of only minor
   consideration by foresters when selecting tree species to plant, but
   growth reductions from pests and pathogens are commonly large relative
   to productivity differences among tree species. Because the selection of
   tree species and sites when establishing plantation forests has
   potential effects on subsequent damage by pests, there is need for
   consideration of joint effects of tree species, site quality, and risk
   of pests. We tested here how site quality influences the response of two
   pines species that differ in their evolutionary history with a primary
   pest in the system. Our specific research objectives were to (1) measure
   the growth response of two pine species (the native Pinus pinaster and
   the introduced P. radiata) to defoliation by the pine pro cessionary
   moth, across a gradient of nutrient availability and (2) compare the
   constitutive and delayed defoliation induced chemical defenses of these
   two pine species on sites of low and high quality. We analyzed variation
   in foliar nitrogen, terpenes, tannins, total phenols and four defensive
   proteins. The impact on tree growth from experimentally applied
   defoliation by PPM was surprisingly low. Even with complete defoliation,
   large sample sizes, and baseline measurements that accounted for much of
   the variation among trees, we observed only modest effects on diameter
   growth and no effects on height growth; volume growth was initially
   reduced by only 6-8\% initially, with full recovery within 3 years of
   defoliation. Pinus radiata, the faster growing species, had higher
   concentrations than P. pinaster of foliar N while P. pinaster had up to
   12 times higher concentrations of terpenes, these results match with
   predictions of the resource availability hypothesis (RAH). Pinus radiata
   foliage was relatively rich in tannins and total phenolics. The pine
   species also differed in defensive proteins. Pinuspinaster had higher
   concentrations of peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and
   chitinase (CHI), while P. radiata had higher concentrations of trypsin
   inhibitor (TI). Finally there was no evidence for delayed inducible
   defenses in either pine species following PPM defoliation; both species
   seem to use other defensive strategies to counter predictable attacks by
   the herbivore. In our study region, defoliation by PPM may not be a
   primary consideration in the selection of pine species for production
   forests, but this conclusion need not hold in regions where pines grow
   more slowly or are exposed to multiple years of defoliation by PPM. (C)

Abstract = {{Herbivorous insect pests living in the soil represent a significant
   challenge to food security given their persistence, the acute damage
   they cause to plants and the difficulties associated with managing their
   populations. Ecological research effort into rhizosphere interactions
   has increased dramatically in the last decade and we are beginning to
   understand, in particular, the ecology of how plants defend themselves
   against soil-dwelling pests. In this review, we synthesise information
   about four key ecological mechanisms occurring in the rhizosphere or.
   surrounding soil that confer plant protection against root herbivores.
   We focus on root tolerance, root resistance via direct physical and
   chemical defences, particularly via acquisition of silicon-based plant
   defences, integration of plant mutualists (microbes and entomopathogenic
   nematodes, EPNs) and the influence of soil history and feedbacks. Their
   suitability as management tools, current limitations for their
   application, and the opportunities for development are evaluated. We
   identify opportunities for synergy between these aspects of rhizosphere
   ecology, such as mycorrhizal fungi negatively affecting pests at the
   root-interface but also increasing plant uptake of silicon, which is
   also known to reduce herbivory. Finally, we set out research priorities

Abstract = {{Recent interest in using trait-based approaches to understand and
   predict ecosystem processes and evolutionary responses to environmental
   change highlights the need to understand the relative importance of
   genetic and environmental sources of intraspecific trait variation
   within local populations of dominant species. Here, I combine plant
   defence theory with functional approaches to quantify genetic trait
   variation and phenotypic trait plasticity of nine goldenrod (Solidago
   altissima) genotypes derived from a local field population in
   Connecticut, USA, to herbivory along a nutrient supply gradient. I found
   that increasing nutrient supply changed the dominant plant defence
   strategy from tolerance to induced resistance. Induced resistance was
   detected through decreased herbivore growth rates and a behavioural
   feeding shift of grasshoppers to older leaf tissue. This could not be
   fully accounted for through stoichiometric changes in leaf tissue
   quality. A multidimensional phenotype approach revealed that abiotic and
   biotic environments (nutrients and herbivory) accounted for almost as
   much whole-plant trait variation (31\%) as did plant genotype (36\%).
   Increasing nutrient supply and herbivory resulted in independent and
   differential effects on whole-plant trait expression. Increasing both
   treatments concurrently produced a unique plant phenotype with increased
   leaf carbon content and allocation to asexual reproduction (ExE).
   Notably, individual genotypes exhibited different magnitudes of
   multivariate trait plasticity to nutrient and herbivory gradients.
   However, the population of genotypes as a whole within a given
   environment expressed an approximately equal magnitude of trait
   variation across both permissive (high nutrient, no herbivory) and
   stressful (low nutrient, high herbivory) environments. Quantifying
   plasticity in defensive strategy in concert with correlated whole-plant
   trait expression changes across multiple abiotic and biotic factors may
   be key to providing a mechanistic understanding of how heterogeneous
   landscapes impact community interactions and ecosystem processes.}},

Abstract = {{Plant competition may mediate the impacts of herbivory on invasive plant
   species through effects on plant growth and defense. This may
   predictably depend on whether herbivory occurs above or below ground and
   on relative plant competitive ability. We simulated the potential impact
   of above-or belowground damage by biocontrol agents on the growth of a
   woody invader (Chinese tallow tree, Triadica sebifera) through
   artificial herbivory, with or without competition with a native grass,
   little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). We measured two defense
   responses of Triadica through quantifying constitutive and induced
   extrafloral nectar production and tolerance of above-and belowground
   damage (root and shoot biomass regrowth). We examined genetic variation
   in plant growth and defense across native (China) and invasive (United
   States) Triadica populations. Without competition, aboveground damage
   had a greater impact than belowground damage on Triadica performance,
   whereas with competition and above-and belowground damage impacted
   Triadica similarly. Whole plant tolerance to damage below ground was
   negatively associated with tolerance to grass competitors indicating
   tradeoffs in the ability to tolerate herbivory vs. compete. Competition
   reduced investment in defensive extrafloral nectar (EFN) production.
   Aboveground damage inhibited rather than induced EFN production while
   belowground plant damage did not impact aboveground nectar production.
   We found some support for the evolution of increased competitive ability
   hypothesis for invasive plants as United States plants were larger than
   native China plants and were more plastic in their response to biotic
   stressors than China plants (they altered their root to shoot ratios
   dependent on herbivory and competition treatments). Our results indicate
   that habitat type and the presence of competitors may be a larger
   determinant of herbivory impact than feeding mode and suggest that
   integrated pest management strategies including competitive dynamics of
   recipient communities should be incorporated into biological control
   agent evaluation at earlier stages.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, an increasing number of studies have
   quantified the effects of herbivory on plant populations using
   stage-structured population models and integral projection models,
   allowing for the calculation of plant population growth rates (lambda)
   with and without herbivory. In this paper, I assembled 29 studies and
   conducted a meta-regression to determine the importance of invertebrate
   herbivores to population growth rates (lambda) while accounting for
   missing data. I found that invertebrate herbivory often induced
   important reductions in plant population growth rates (with herbivory,
   lambda was 1.08 +/- 0.36; without herbivory, lambda was 1.28 +/- 0.58).
   This relationship tended to be weaker for seed predation than for other
   types of herbivory, except when seed predation rates were very high.
   Even so, the amount by which studies reduced herbivory was a poor
   predictor of differences in population growth rates-which strongly
   cautions against using measured herbivory rates as a proxy for the
   impact of herbivores. Herbivory reduced plant population growth rates
   significantly more when potential growth rates were high, which helps to
   explain why there was less variation in actual population growth rates
   than in potential population growth rates. The synthesis of these
   studies also shows the need for future studies to report variance in
   estimates of lambda and to quantify how lambda varies as a function of
   plant density.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation affects species and their interactions through
   intertwined mechanisms that include changes to fragment area, shape,
   connectivity and distance to edge. Disentangling these pathways is a
   fundamental challenge of landscape ecology and will help identify
   ecological processes important for management of rare species or
   restoration of fragmented habitats. In a landscape experiment that
   manipulated connectivity, fragment shape, and distance to edge while
   holding fragment area constant, we examined how fragmentation impacts
   herbivory and growth of nine plant species in longleaf pine savanna.
   Probability of herbivory in open habitat was strongly dependent on
   proximity to forest edge for every species, increasing with distance to
   edge in six species (primarily grasses and annual forbs) and decreasing
   in three species (perennial forbs and a shrub). In the two species of
   perennial forbs, these edge effects were dependent on fragment shape;
   herbivory strongly decreased with distance to edge in fragments of two
   shapes, but not in a third shape. For most species, however, probability
   of herbivory was unrelated to connectivity or fragment shape. Growth was
   generally determined more strongly by leaf herbivory than by distance to
   edge, fragment shape, or connectivity. Taken together, these results
   demonstrate consistently strong edge effects on herbivory, one of the
   most important biotic factors determining plant growth and demography.
   Our results contrast with the generally inconsistent results of
   observational studies, likely because our experimental approach enabled
   us to tease apart landscape processes that are typically confounded.}},

Abstract = {{Resistance and tolerance are two ways that plants cope with herbivory.
   Tolerance, the ability of a plant to regrow or reproduce after being
   consumed, has been studied less than resistance, but this trait varies
   widely among species and has considerable potential to affect the
   ecology of plant species. One particular aspect of tolerance,
   compensatory responses, can evolve rapidly in plant species; providing
   insight into interactions between consumers and plants. However,
   compensation by invasive species has rarely been explored. We compared
   compensatory responses to the effects of simulated herbivory expressed
   by plants from seven Solidago gigantea populations from the native North
   American range to that expressed by plants from nine populations from
   the nonnative European range. Populations were also collected along
   elevational gradients to compare ecotypic variation within and between
   ranges. Solidago plants from the nonnative range of Europe were more
   tolerant to herbivory than plants from the native range of North
   America. Furthermore, plants from European populations increased in
   total biomass and growth rate with elevation, but decreased in
   compensatory response. There were no relationships between elevation and
   growth or compensation for North American populations. Our results
   suggest that Solidago gigantea may have evolved to better compensate for
   herbivory damage in Europe, perhaps in response to a shift to greater
   proportion of attack from generalists. Our results also suggest a
   possible trade-off between rapid growth and compensation to damage in
   European populations but not in North American populations.}},

   The effects of the two stresses were additive for S. gigantea but

   inflorescence biomass. Both species, when under stress, reallocated
   resources toward asexual reproduction (rhizomes) and away from sexual

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{618-626}},

Abstract = {{Ecological limits to phenotypic plasticity (PP), induced by simultaneous
   biotic and abiotic factors, can prevent organisms from exhibiting
   optimal plasticity, and in turn lead to decreased fitness. Herbivory is
   an important biotic stressor and may limit plant functional responses to
   challenging environmental conditions such as shading. In this study we
   investigated whether plant functional responses and PP to shade are
   constrained by herbivory, and whether such constraints are due to direct
   effects based on resource limitation by considering ontogeny. We used as
   a model system the relict tree Prunus lusitanica and implemented an
   indoor experiment to quantify the response of saplings of different ages
   to shade and herbivory. We measured five functional traits and
   quantitatively calculated PP. Results showed that herbivory did not
   constrain functional responses or PP to shade except for shoot:root
   ratio (SR), which, despite showing a high PP in damaged saplings,
   decreased under shade instead of increasing. Damaged saplings of older
   age did not exhibit reduced constraints on functional responses to shade
   and generally presented a lower PP than damaged saplings of younger age.
   Our findings suggest that herbivory-mediated constraints on plant
   plasticity to shade may not be as widespread as previously thought.
   Nonetheless, the negative effect of herbivory on SR plastic expression
   to shade could be detrimental for plant fitness. Finally, our results
   suggest a secondary role of direct effects (resource-based) on
   P.lusitanica plasticity limitation. Further studies should quantify
   plant resources in order to gain a better understanding of this

Abstract = {{Whether large carnivores indirectly influence vegetation via prey
   behavior remains controversial because available evidence is largely
   correlational, and recent field experiments have found weak associations
   between risk experienced by prey and vegetative responses to herbivory.
   We combined observational data and a field experiment to test whether an
   ambush predator-the puma (Puma concolor)-affected the antipredator
   behavior of its primary ungulate prey-the vicuna (Vicugna vicugna)-which
   in turn had cascading effects on vegetation. We predicted that strong
   protective effects of pumas on vegetation would be most apparent in
   habitats where cover and terrain (i.e., physical complexity) facilitated
   the ambushing strategy of pumas. In 3 different habitats, we evaluated
   the relationships among predation risk, vicuna behavior, and-by
   deploying vicuna exclosures-vegetation structure and productivity. We
   also examined habitat-specific rates of vegetative regrowth. Risky
   habitats presented high physical complexity, a disproportionately large
   number of vicunas killed by pumas, and high relative abundance of pumas.
   In these habitats, vicunas displayed strong antipredator behaviors and
   exclosures did not affect vegetation, suggesting that pumas indirectly
   protected plants. Conversely, a safe habitat presented low structural
   complexity, a disproportionately low number of vicunas killed by pumas,
   and low relative abundance of pumas. Here, vicunas relaxed antipredator
   behaviors and exclosures had strong effects on vegetation. In 1 habitat
   deemed as risky, however, cascading effects were offset likely because
   water and nutrients were readily available to plants and regrowth was
   rapid. Our results show that large ambush carnivores can positively
   affect vegetation via nonconsumptive effects on their prey, and that
   these effects are habitat mediated. However, primary productivity
   modulated the strength of such effects, with high primary productivity
   dampening the observed cascading effects.}},

Abstract = {{By altering the strength of intra- and interspecific competition,
   droughts may reshape plant communities. Furthermore, species may respond
   differently to drought when other influences, such as herbivory, are
   considered. To explore this relationship, we conducted a greenhouse
   experiment measuring responses to inter- and intraspecific competition
   for two grasses, Schedonorus arundinaceus and Paspalum dilatatum, while
   varying water availability and simulating herbivory via clipping. We
   then parameterized population growth models to examine the long-term
   outcome of competition under these conditions. Under drought, S.
   arundinaceus was less water stressed than P. dilatatum, which exhibited
   severe water stress; clipping alleviated this stress, increasing the
   competitive ability of P. dilatatum relative to S. arundinaceus.
   Although P. dilatatum competed weakly under drought, clipping reduced
   water stress in P. dilatatum, thereby enhancing its ability to compete
   with S. arundinaceus under drought. Supporting these observations,
   population growth models predicted that P. dilatatum would exclude S.
   arundinaceus when clipped under drought, while S. arundinaceus would
   exclude P. dilatatum when unclipped under drought. When the modeled
   environment varied temporally, environmental variation promoted niche
   differences that, though insufficient to maintain stable coexistence,
   prevented unconditional competitive exclusion by promoting priority
   effects. Our results suggest that it is important to consider how
   species respond not just to stable, but also to variable, environments.
   When species differ in their responses to drought, competition, and
   simulated herbivory, stable environments may promote competitive
   exclusion, while fluctuating environments may promote coexistence. These

Abstract = {{Native generalist herbivores might limit plant invasion by consuming
   invading plants or enhance plant invasion by selectively avoiding them.
   The role of herbivores in plant invasion has been investigated in
   relation to plant native/introduced status, however, a knowledge gap
   exists about whether food selection occurs according to
   native/introduced status or to species. We tested preference of the
   native herbivore white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for
   widespread and frequently occurring invasive introduced and native
   plants in the northeastern United States. Multiple-choice deer
   preference trials were conducted for the species and relative preference
   was determined using biomass consumption and feeding behavior. While
   more native than introduced plant biomass was consumed overall, deer
   food selection varied strongly by plant species. Results show consistent
   deer avoidance of several invasive introduced plants (Alliaria
   petiolata, Berberis thunbergii, and Microstegium vimineum) and a native
   plant (Dennstaedtia punctilobula). Other invasive introduced plants
   (Celastrus orbiculatus, Ligustrum vulgare, and Lonicera morrowii) and a
   native plant (Acer rubrum) were highly preferred. These results provide
   evidence that herbivore impacts on plant invaders depend on plant
   species palatability. Consequently, herbivore selectivity likely plays
   an important role in the invasion process. To the extent that herbivory
   impacts population demographics, these results suggest that native
   generalist herbivores promote enemy release of some plant invaders by
   avoiding them and contribute to biotic resistance of others by consuming
   them.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of foundation plants in bare mudflats is a critical
   process. While consumers are increasingly recognized to exert strong
   top-down control of plant performance in salt marshes, studies to date
   have focused on the effects of consumers on mature stands rather than on
   plants that are recolonizing after disturbance or where restoration has
   occurred. Furthermore, whether consumer-facilitated fungal infection
   differentially affects newly establishing plants in mudflats compared to
   mature stands remains poorly understood. In a salt marsh in southern
   Brazil, we examined the effects of herbivory by the crab Neohelice
   granulata and fungal infection on the survival and growth of Spartina
   alterniflora transplanted into mudflats. We additionally tested the
   effects of herbivory and fungi on newly established versus
   well-established stands of S. alterniflora. Highly intensive natural
   crab herbivory significantly reduced the development of S. alterniflora
   and increased its fungal infection by 50\%. Light herbivory, removing
   only small areas of plant leaves, reduced the height growth and leaf
   production of directly affected tillers by about 14 to 18\%, and both
   newly and well-established, clonally integrated stands of S.
   alterniflora allocated energy towards the formation of new tillers.
   While herbivory facilitated fungal infection and subsequent fungal
   damage in leaves, no significant effects of fungicide treatment or its
   interactions with crab grazing on S. alterniflora growth were detected,
   suggesting a saprophytic rather than a pathogenic role of fungi in this
   3-species interaction. Here, we found that marsh grasses transplanted
   for restoration or those colonizing disturbance-generated mudflats may
   be facilitated by protection against consumers.}},

Abstract = {{While many studies demonstrate that herbivores alter selection on plant

   antiherbivore defenses could alter selection on reproductive traits by

   we used white clover, Trifolium repens, which has a Mendelian
   polymorphism for the production of hydrogen cyanidea potent

   cyanogenic defenses altered natural selection on petal morphology and
   the number of flowers within inflorescences via female fitness.
   Herbivory influenced selection on flowers and phenology via female

Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{561-571}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous plant symbionts that
   affect plant nutrient status, patterns of resource allocation and rates
   of plant growth. In addition, AMF influence the expression of plant
   defence, which may affect subsequent interactions between plants and
   higher trophic levels. Tolerance to herbivory and chemical defence
   represent two distinct defence strategies of plants, and there is
   accumulating evidence that AMF can influence each strategy separately.
   However, investigations on the simultaneous effects of AMF on tolerance
   and chemical defence mechanisms are lacking. Using six milkweed
   (Asclepias) species and three levels of AMF inoculum, we show that plant
   tolerance to herbivory increases with foliar P concentrations, while
   both foliar cardenolide concentration and latex exudation (major
   chemical defences in milkweeds) increase with foliar N concentrations,
   but decrease with plant growth rate. Additionally, foliar cardenolide
   concentration increases with foliar P concentration, and latex exudation
   increases with root biomass. Because AMF have significant effects on all
   of these traits (foliar N and P concentrations, root biomass and growth
   rate), AMF can change plant tolerance and chemical defence
   simultaneously, albeit through different mechanisms.Synthesis. Overall,
   plant tolerance and chemical defence to herbivores are affected by AMF
   through changes in basic plant physiology such as nutrient status,
   allocation patterns and growth rate, and our study suggests that it may
   be possible to predict effects of AMF on plant defences through these

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{Some plant functional groups such as nonnative invasive and nitrogen
   (N)-fixing plants are widely thought to have consistent, coordinated
   differences in their functional traits relative to other groups such as
   native and non -N-fixing plants. Recent evidence suggests that these
   trait differences between groups can be context dependent, varying with
   environmental factors such as resource availability and disturbance.
   However, many previous comparisons among plant groups differing in
   invasion status have not standardized growth form between groups or have
   compared species that do not co-occur, which could result in invasion
   status per se being confounded with other factors. We determined growth
   and leaf functional trait responses of 20 co-occurring woody species,
   that is, five species within each of four functional groups (native
   N-fixers, native non -N-fixers, nonnative {[}invasive] N-fixers and
   nonnative {[}invasive] non-N-fixers), to factorial combinations of soil
   fertility and defoliation treatments in a mesocosm experiment to test
   each of two hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that nonnative invasive
   and N-fixing species will have functional traits associated with rapid
   resource acquisition whereas natives and non -N-fixing species will have
   traits linked to resource conservation. Second, we hypothesized that
   plant growth and leaf traits of nonnative and N-fixing species will be
   more strongly influenced by environmental factors (i.e., soil fertility
   and disturbance) than will natives and non-N-fixers. Plant growth,
   foliar nutrients, and leaf structural traits varied among plant
   functional groups in a manner consistent with our first hypothesis.
   Support for our second hypothesis was mixed; origin (native vs.
   nonnative) and soil fertility rarely interacted to determine plant
   growth or variation in leaf traits whereas interactions involving
   N-fixing ability and soil fertility were common. Further, there were no
   consistent interactive effects between plant groupings and disturbance.
   Our results demonstrate that variation in growth and functional traits
   among plant species were driven primarily by the relatively large
   responses of nonnative N-fixers to soil fertility, rather than by
   consistent differences between other plant functional groups. These
   findings highlight the importance of resource availability in
   determining trait or performance differences among plant functional
   groups, and provide insights into the assembly of plant functional
   traits in novel communities of co-occurring native and nonnative
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Although the concept that some plants benefit from being eaten is
   counterintuitive, there is now considerable evidence demonstrating
   enhanced fitness following herbivory. It has been assumed that plants
   growing in high resource conditions are the ones best able to compensate
   for herbivory. However, just the opposite has been found for
   dicotyledonous plants exhibiting patterns of overcompensation, with most
   occurring in resource-poor conditions. Long-term studies of the
   monocarpic biennial, scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata growing in
   resource-poor conditions have shown that ungulate herbivory by mule deer
   and elk can result in a threefold increase in plant fitness over uneaten
   controls. These observations led us to hypothesize that fungal
   associations would facilitate the compensatory response most commonly
   observed in this Arizona population of scarlet gilia; perhaps
   mutualistic associations with fungi, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi, would explain the phenomenon of overcompensation altogether.
   Fungal removal experiments, using CaptanA (R), a commercially available
   fungicide, showed that a reduction in fungal abundance altered the
   compensatory response following ungulate herbivory, particularly in
   years in which water was limited, increasing fitness compensation from
   equal compensation to overcompensation. A multifactorial experiment
   revealed that the interactive effects of water and fungicide maximized
   fruit production following herbivory. Our results are counter to the
   ``modification of tolerance hypothesis{''} in which plants associating
   with mycorrhizal fungi will have higher tolerance to herbivory. It is
   likely that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes
   compete with plants for photosynthates following herbivory, thereby
   limiting the magnitude of compensation. Thus, fungi appear to be
   parasitic on scarlet gilia following ungulate herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{An ability to tolerate recurrent defoliation likely plays a role in the

   been extensively studied. The growth response of two decreasers, three
   Increaser II grasses, and an Increaser III species to frequent, severe
   defoliation under three levels of competition from neighbours and two
   levels of soil nutrients was examined in a pot trial. The effects of
   competition and especially nutrients markedly modified the defoliation
   tolerance of different species, and grazing response groups varied in
   the manner in which their defoliation responses were mediated by these

   productivity most in nutrient-rich, competition-free environments,
   probably because it exacerbates a carbon limitation on growth. However,
   nutrient enrichment did enable Increaser II grasses, but not other
   species, to better tolerate intense defoliation, explaining why they can
   persist on intensively grazed fertile patches and in heavily stocked

Abstract = {{Woody plants regularly sustain biomass losses to herbivorous insects.
   Consequently, they have developed various resistance mechanisms to cope
   with insect attack. However, these mechanisms of defense and how they
   are affected by resource availability are not well understood. The
   present study aimed at evaluating and comparing the natural resistance
   (antibiosis and tolerance) of balsam fir (Abies balsamea {[}L] Mill.)
   and white spruce (Picea glauca {[}Moench) Voss] to spruce budworm,
   Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), and how drainage site quality as a
   component of resource availability affects the expression of resistance
   over time (6 years). Our results showed that there are differences in
   natural resistance between the two tree species to spruce budworm, but
   it was not significantly affected by drainage quality. Balsam fir
   exhibited higher foliar toxic secondary compounds concentrations than
   white spruce in all drainage classes, resulting in lower male pupal
   mass, survival and longer male developmental time. This, however, did
   not prevent spruce budworm from consuming more foliage in balsam fir
   than in white spruce. This response suggests that either natural levels
   of measured secondary compounds do not provide sufficient toxicity to
   reduce defoliation, or spruce budworm has developed compensatory
   mechanisms, which allow it to utilize food resources more efficiently or
   minimize the toxic effects that are produced by its host's defensive
   compounds. Larvae exhibited lower pupal mass and higher mortality in
   rapidly drained and subhygric sites. Drainage class also affected the
   amount of foliage destroyed but its impact varied over the years and was
   probably influenced by climatic variables. These results demonstrate the

Abstract = {{1. Mutualistic and antagonistic above-ground and below-ground species
   have the potential to be involved in strong interactions that can either
   weaken or strengthen their individual impacts on plants. Their impacts

   traits and survival. Few studies have explored the effect of herbivore
   and detritivore interactions with parent plants on offspring vital
   life-cycle processes, such as seedling emergence rate, seedling
   establishment and offspring survival.
   2. In the field, I experimentally studied the combined effects of floral
   herbivores (FH), root herbivores (RH) and detritivores on plant growth
   and reproduction of Moricandia moricandioides (Brassicaceae). In
   particular, I analysed the trans-generational effects of herbivores and
   detritivores on seed and juvenile production as well as on vital
   life-cycle processes (i.e. seedling emergence rates, survival).
   3. Floral herbivores strongly reduced the number of flowers, fruits,
   seeds and juveniles. Detritivores had an impact on plant success by
   increasing seed quality (\% N and N : C ratio), although the effect was
   altered by the presence of floral and RH.
   4. I found maternal effects (trans-generational effects) of FH, RH and
   detritivores. Floral herbivores reduced seedling emergence and
   establishment. Floral and RH in combination reduced seedling emergence
   timing, but the effect was counteracted by detritivores. Detritivores
   also reduced the negative effect of FH on offspring mortality rate.
   5. This study shows that the impact of above-ground and below-ground
   organisms on M. moricandioides plants go beyond seed production and were
   evident in the probability of establishment and survival of the
   following generation. Trans-generational effects were induced by all

   NPPgap each year ranged from -9.2\% to 13.1\% for each site and on

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to explore various factors associated with
   radio frequency identification (RFID) adoption with quantitative
   meta-analysis. More specifically, this paper attempts to measure key
   variables of RFID adoption derived from Rogers' innovation theory and
   further examines how state intervention influences the process of RFD
   adoption. First, this paper compares, relying on a meta-analysis,
   various mean effect sizes among technological, organizational and
   environmental factors (i.e. government-driven policies) that Rogers
   suggested in his innovation model.
   Design/methodology/approach - In mean effect size analysis, this paper
   finds that the technological factor is the most powerful factor that
   affects the RFID adoption. The technological factor is statistically
   significant across all regions, including North America, Europe and
   Asia. The organizational factor is significant only in developing
   countries like Southeast Asian countries and East Asian countries.
   Environmental factors like government intervention for facilitating RFID
   adoption are strong enough only in Southeast Asia and Europe.
   Findings - This paper finds that government's supportive policy is more
   effective in Europe but not in America, while external pressure is still
   more effective in Southeast Asia. These results implicate that
   developmentalism or government-driven policy can be effective not only
   in developing countries but also in the case of developed countries. In
   addition, this paper conducts a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)
   analysis based on Fisher's standardized score.
   Originality/value - In SUR analysis, this paper finds that the
   correlations between RFID adoption intention and three innovation
   factors vary across industrial areas. More specifically, the
   manufacturing area shows negative moderating effect on all three
   equations where correlations between Rogers' innovation factors and RFID
   adoption intention are meta-dependent variables. Also, RFD adoption is
   accelerated when the size of the firm is large or the location of the
   firm is in Southeast Asia. This result implicates that the aspect of
   technology adoption can be changed by region and type of industry.}},

Abstract = {{Stressors and heterogeneity are ubiquitous features of natural
   environments, and theory suggests that when environmental qualities
   alter flowering schedules through phenotypic plasticity, assortative
   mating can result that promotes evolutionary divergence. Therefore, it
   is important to determine whether common ecological stressors induce
   similar changes in flowering time. We review previous studies to
   determine whether two important stressors, water restriction and
   herbivory, induce consistent flowering time responses among species; for
   example, how often do water restriction and herbivory both delay
   flowering? We focus on the direction of change in flowering time, which
   affects the potential for divergence in heterogeneous environments. We
   also tested whether these stressors influenced time to flowering and
   nonphenology traits using Mimulus guttatus. The literature review
   suggests that water restriction has variable effects on flowering time,
   whereas herbivory delays flowering with exceptional consistency. In the
   Mimulus experiment, low water and herbivory advanced and delayed
   flowering, respectively. Overall, our results temper theoretical
   predictions for evolutionary divergence due to habitat-induced changes
   in flowering time; in particular, we discuss how accounting for
   variation in the direction of change in flowering time can either
   increase or decrease the potential for divergence. In addition, we
   caution against adaptive interpretations of stress-induced phenology
   shifts.}},

Abstract = {{A long-standing theory, originating with Darwin, suggests that abiotic
   forces set species range limits at high latitude, high elevation, and
   other abiotically `stressful' areas, while species interactions set
   range limits in apparently more benign regions. This theory is of
   considerable importance for both basic and applied ecology, and while it
   is often assumed to be a ubiquitous pattern, it has not been clearly
   defined or broadly tested. We review tests of this idea and dissect how
   the strength of species interactions must vary across stress gradients

   to better test this theory, which will deepen our understanding of the

Abstract = {{Tolerance to herbivory is an adaptation that promotes regrowth and

   hypothesized that the effect of competition on tolerance can be
   different for different genotypes within a species and we tested how

   inflicted apical or leaf damage in siblings of 29 families of an annual
   plant Raphanus raphanistrum (Brassicaceae) grown at high or low
   competition. There was a negative correlation of family tolerance levels
   between competition treatments: plant families with high tolerance to
   apical damage in the low competition treatment had low tolerance to
   apical damage in the high competition treatment and vice versa. We found
   no costs of tolerance, in terms of a trade-off between tolerance to
   apical and leaf damage or between tolerance and competitive ability, or
   an allocation cost in terms of reduced fitness of highly tolerant
   families in the undamaged state. High tolerance bound to a specific

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1901-1911}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Mammalian herbivores, particularly white-tailed
   deer, can have a major impact on plant abundance and distribution.
   However, plants can tolerate herbivory by increasing seed production or
   seed quality. We used the monocarpic perennial Prenanthes roanensis to
   examine tolerance to mammalian herbivory through seed quality and
   modeled the effects of tolerance on population growth rate.
   METHODS: We examined seed quality (proportion of viable seeds, seed
   mass, germination, and seedling size) on damaged and undamaged plants to
   determine the extent to which plants tolerate herbivory. We then varied
   seed quality parameters over a range of values in population models to
   compare population growth rates under ``no-tolerance{''} conditions
   (herbivory, but no tolerance) to those under ``tolerance{''} conditions.
   KEY RESULTS: In most populations, plants damaged by herbivores had a
   greater proportion of viable seeds per plant or a greater probability of
   seed germination. Incorporating observed tolerance into population
   models did not significantly increase population growth rate. However,
   at low germination rates, increased germination of seeds from damaged
   plants has the potential to significantly increase population growth
   rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: Damaged plants can compensate for loss of reproductive
   heads by increasing seed viability and germination rates in the
   remaining seeds. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that
   tolerance through seed quality has the potential to affect population
   growth rate. Our results suggest that incorporating tolerance into
   population models may help elucidate mechanisms by which plant
   populations persist despite herbivory.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The spatial arrangement of past and present human activities could
   affect the strength of species interactions through changes to
   environmental conditions. To better understand how land-use history
   might mediate the effect of insect herbivory on the growth of four
   herbaceous plant species at the edges between woodlands and open
   savannas, we coupled large-scale manipulations of canopy structure by
   thinning overstory trees to create savanna habitat in non-agricultural
   and post-agricultural longleaf pine woodlands with local-scale herbivore
   exclosures at two distances from habitat edges. Light availability,
   grasshopper abundance, and herbaceous plant cover all increased in
   patches that received overstory tree thinning. Land-use history altered
   the effect that edges created by the overstory thinning treatments had
   on grasshopper herbivory for one plant species (Carphephorus
   bellidifolius). The edge between land-use histories also altered
   herbivore effects on three plant species in thinned patches. These edge
   effects were driven in part by changes in availability of alternative
   resources for grasshoppers, shady edges, or grasshopper abundance.
   Canopy manipulation also had important effects on herbivory that were
   independent of the habitat edge: grasshopper herbivory reduced plant
   growth of the smallest species (C. bellidifolius) regardless of canopy
   manipulation, whereas herbivory on two larger species (Solidago
   nemoralis and So. odora) reduced plant growth mainly in patches with an
   intact overstory canopy. Collectively, this work suggests that the
   species-specific effects of grasshopper herbivory on plant growth were
   driven by both plant traits (e.g., size or growth rates) and
   landscape-mediated changes to grasshopper abundance, light availability,
   or availability of alternative resources for grasshoppers created by
   land-use history and canopy structure. Furthermore, because the
   heterogeneity in herbivory revealed by our large-scale experiment is
   likely linked to plant traits, our results provide a means for
   understanding the profound, but often idiosyncratic, effects of land-use
   legacies and edges on plant populations and communities.}},

   Several studies indicate that root-attacked plants can re-allocate
   resources to the aboveground parts. However, the connection between
   tolerance and root regrowth remains poorly understood. We investigated
   the timing and extent of root regrowth of tolerant and susceptible lines
   of maize, Zeamays L. (Poaceae), attacked by the western corn rootworm,
   Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), in
   the laboratory and the field. Infested tolerant maize plants produced
   more root biomass and even overcompensated for the lost roots, whereas
   this effect was absent in susceptible lines. Furthermore, the tolerant
   plants slowed growth of new roots in the greenhouse and in the field 4-8
   days after infestation, whereas susceptible plants slowed growth of new
   roots only in the field and only after 12 days of infestation. The quick
   response of tolerant lines may have enabled them to escape root attack
   by starving the herbivores and by saving resources for regrowth after
   the attack had ceased. We conclude that both timing and the extent of
   regrowth may determine plant tolerance to root herbivory.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Release from specialist insect herbivores may allow invasive plants to
   evolve traits associated with decreased resistance and increased
   competitive ability. Given that there may be genetic trade-off between
   resistance and tolerance, invasive plants could also become more
   tolerant to herbivores. Although it is widely acknowledged that light
   availability affects tolerance to herbivores, little information is
   available for whether the effect of light availability on tolerance
   differ between the introduced and native populations. We conducted a
   common garden experiment in the introduced range of Alternanthera
   philoxeroides using ten invasive US and ten native Argentinean
   populations at two levels of light availability and in the presence or
   absence of a specialist stem-boring insect Agasicles hygrophila. Plant
   biomass (total and storage root biomass), two allocation traits
   (root/shoot ratio and branch intensity, branches biomass/main stem
   biomass) and two functional traits (specific stem length and specific
   leaf area), which are potentially associated with herbivore resistance
   and light capture, were measured. Overall, we found that A.
   philoxeroides from introduced ranges had comparable biomass and
   tolerance to specialist herbivores, lower branch intensity, lower
   specific stem length and specific leaf area. Moreover, introduced
   populations displayed higher shade tolerance of storage root biomass and
   lower plastic response to shading in specific stem length. Finally,
   light availability had no significant effect on evolution of tolerance
   to specialist herbivores of A. philoxeroides. Our results suggest that
   post-introduction evolution might have occurred in A. philoxeroides.
   While light availability did not influence the evolution of tolerance to
   specialist herbivores, increased shade tolerance and release from
   specialist insects might have contributed to the successful invasion of
   A. philoxeroides.}},

Abstract = {{An important asset for the management of wild ungulates is recognizing
   the spatial distribution of forage quality across heterogeneous
   landscapes. To do so typically requires knowledge of which plant species
   are eaten, in what abundance they are eaten, and what their nutritional
   quality might be. Acquiring such data, however, may be difficult and
   time consuming. Here, we are proposing a rapid and cost-effective forage
   quality monitoring tool that combines near infrared (NIR) spectra of
   fecal samples and easily obtained data on plant community composition.
   Our approach rests on the premise that NIR spectra of fecal samples
   collected within low population density exclosures reflect the optimal
   forage quality of a given landscape. Forage quality can thus be based on
   the Mahalanobis distance of fecal spectral scans across the landscape
   relative to fecal spectral scans inside exclosures (referred to as
   DISTEX). The Gi{*} spatial autocorrelation statistic can then be applied
   among neighboring DISTEX values to detect and map ``hot spots{''} and
   ``cold spots{''} of nutritional quality over the landscape. We tested
   our approach in a heterogeneous boreal landscape on Anticosti Island
   (Quebec, Canada), where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
   populations over the landscape have ranged from 20 to 50
   individuals/km(2) for at least 80 years, resulting in a loss of most
   palatable and nutritious plant species. Our results suggest that hot
   spots of forage quality occur when old-growth balsam fir stands comprise
   >39.8\% of 300 ha neighborhoods, whereas cold spots occur in laggs
   (i.e., transition zones from forest to peatland). In terms of
   ground-level indicator plant species, the presence of Canada bunchberry
   (Cornus canadensis) was highly correlated with hot spots, whereas
   tamarack (Larix laricina) was highly correlated with cold spots. Mean
   DISTEX values were positively and significantly correlated with the
   neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin contents of feces.
   While our approach would need more independent field trials before it is
   fully validated, its low cost and ease of execution should make it a
   valuable tool for advancing both the basic and applied ecology of large
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic species dominate many communities; however the functional

   mineral nutrient supplies and vertebrate herbivory. Exotic species are
   six times more likely to dominate communities than native species.
   Furthermore, while experimental nutrient addition increases the cover

   cover. Native and exotic species also differ in their response to
   vertebrate consumer exclusion. These results suggest that species origin
   has functional significance, and that eutrophication will lead to

Abstract = {{Increases in terrestrial primary productivity across the Arctic and
   northern alpine ecosystems are leading to altered vegetation composition
   and stature. Changes in vegetation stature may affect predator-prey
   interactions via changes in the prey's ability to detect predators,
   changes in predation pressure, predator identity and predator foraging
   strategy. Changes in productivity and vegetation composition may also
   affect herbivores via effects on forage availability and quality. We
   investigated if height-dependent effects of forage and non-forage
   vegetation determine burrowing extent and activity of arctic ground
   squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). We collected data on burrow networks
   and activity of arctic ground squirrels across long-term vegetation
   monitoring sites in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska. The
   implications of height-specific cover of potential forage and non-forage
   vegetation on burrowing behaviour and habitat suitability for arctic

   modelling. Increased cover of forbs was associated with more burrows and
   burrow systems, and higher activity of systems, for all forb heights. No
   other potential forage functional group was related to burrow
   distribution and activity. In contrast, height-dependent negative
   effects of non-forage vegetation were observed, with cover over 50-cm
   height negatively affecting the number of burrows, systems and system
   activity. Our results demonstrate that increases in vegetation
   productivity have dual, potentially counteracting effects on arctic

   Importantly, increases in tall-growing woody vegetation (shrubs and

Abstract = {{Pollution has repeatedly been suggested to increase plant susceptibility
   to insect attack, some diseases and severe climatic conditions. This
   study explored the effects of industrial pollution on leaf damage by
   insect herbivores (primarily defoliators) in two willow species, Salix
   myrsinifolia and S. caprea, growing naturally at different distances
   from two nickel-copper smelters (Harjavalta, SW Finland and Monchegorsk,
   NW Russia). The relationships between pollution load and herbivory were
   variable, from significantly positive to significantly negative.
   However, this variation was not related to the differences between
   polluters, willow species or study years; an overall effect of pollution
   on herbivory, as evaluated by meta-analysis of 12 individual data sets,
   did not differ from zero. This result hints that an overall increase in
   insect herbivory with industrial pollution, discovered in meta-analysis
   of published observational studies, may be an artefact caused by
   research and publication biases.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the relative plant growth and

   introgression of an insect-resistance Bt-transgene from Brassica napus,

   (BC2) from a single backcross family was grown in pure and mixed stands
   of Bt-transgenic and non-transgenic siblings under two insect
   treatments. Various proportions of Bt-transgenic plants were employed in
   mixed stands to study the interaction between resistant and susceptible
   plants. In the pure stands, Bt-transgenic BC2 plants performed better
   than non-transgenic plants with or without insect treatments. In mixed
   stands, Bt-transgenic BC2 plants produced fewer seeds than their non-Bt
   counterparts at low proportions of Bt-transgenic BC2 plants in the
   absence of insects. Reproductive allocation of non-transgenic plants
   marginally increased with increasing proportions of Bt-transgenic plants
   under herbivore pressure, which resulted in increased total biomass and
   seed production per stand. The results showed that the growth of
   non-transgenic plants was protected by Bt-transgenic plants under
   herbivore pressure. The Bt-transgene might not be advantageous in mixed
   stands of backcrossed hybrids; thus transgene introgression would not be
   facilitated when herbivorous insects are not present. However, a
   relatively large initial population of Bt-transgenic plants might result
   in transgene persistence when target herbivores are present.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock grazing is one of the most common and widespread
   forms of land uses in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies assessing the
   effects of extensive livestock grazing on vegetation and soils in SSA
   are inconsistent in the direction and magnitude of study outcomes. We
   applied meta-analysis to identify whether studies so far conducted in
   the rangeland systems of SSA have detected significant rangeland
   degradation as approximated by changes in vegetation attributes
   (reduction in species diversity and richness; decreased biomass and
   ground cover; increased woody species density and canopy cover) and soil
   properties (Decreased soil OC, N and P). We quantified results of the
   included studies using the response ratio, which is the log proportional
   change in the means of a treatment and a control group. Four moderator
   variables (elevation (<1500 and >= 1500 m above sea level); plant life
   form (herbaceous and woody), rainfall amount (<600 mm and >= 600 mm),
   rainfall modality (mono and bimodal), and soil texture (Loam, sandy,
   sandy loam)) appeared to affect the response of species diversity and
   richness patterns to different grazing regimes, i.e., communal grazing
   systems, exclosures, livestock ranches and game reserves. Species
   diversity and richness values were generally lower in the communal
   grazing systems compared to the other grazing regimes. Only three
   moderator variables (rainfall amount and modality, and soil texture)
   affected the herbaceous basal cover response. Differences in soil OC
   were highest between communal and exclosure areas, visible at high
   elevations and under high rainfall. Soil N was influenced by rainfall
   modality and soil texture. We conclude that the effects of grazing
   regimes onto the environment cannot be generalized but are specific
   across vegetation and soil variables and differ considerably with
   rainfall and elevation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Transgene flow through pollen and seeds leads to transgenic
   volunteers and feral populations in the nature, and consumer choice and
   economic incentives determine whether transgenic crops will be
   cultivated in the field. Transgenic and non-transgenic plants are likely

   interactions are not well understood.
   Methods: Field experiments were conducted in an agricultural ecosystem
   with insecticide spraying and a natural ecosystem, using Bt-transgenic
   rice (Oryza sativa) and its non-transgenic counterpart in pure and mixed
   stands with a replacement series.
   Results: Insect damage and competition significantly decreased plant
   growth and reproduction under the coexistence of transgenic and
   conventional rice. Insect-resistant transgenic rice was not
   competitively superior to its counterpart under different densities in
   both agricultural and natural ecosystems, irrespective of insect
   infection. Fitness cost due to Bt-transgene expression occurred only in
   an agroecosystem, where the population yield decreased with increasing
   percentage of transgenic rice. The population yield fluctuated in a
   natural ecosystem, with slight differences among pure and mixed stands
   under plant competition or insect pressure. The presence of Chilo
   suppressalis infection increased the number of non-target insects.
   Conclusions: Plant growth and reproduction patterns, relative
   competition ability and population yield indicate that Bt-transgenic and

   natural habitats, transgenic rice is likely to outcompete non-transgenic

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Increasing rates of change in climate have been observed across the
   planet and have contributed to the ongoing range shifts observed for
   many species. Although ecologists are now using a variety of approaches
   to study how much and through what mechanisms increasing temperature and
   nutrient pollution may influence the invasions inherent in range shifts,
   accurate predictions are still lacking.
   Methods and Results
   In this study, we conducted a factorial experiment, simultaneously
   manipulating warming, nitrogen addition and introduction of Pityopsis
   aspera, to determine how range-shifting species affect a plant
   community. We quantified the resident community using ordination scores,
   then used structural equation modeling to examine hypotheses related to
   how plants respond to a network of experimental treatments and
   environmental variables. Variation in soil pH explained plant community
   response to nitrogen addition in the absence of invasion. However, in
   the presence of invasion, the direct effect of nitrogen on the community
   was negligible and soil moisture was important for explaining nitrogen
   effects. We did not find effects of warming on the native plant
   community in the absence of invasion. In the presence of invasion,
   however, warming had negative effects on functional richness directly
   and invasion and herbivory explained the overall positive effect of
   warming on the plant community.
   Conclusions and Significance
   This work highlights the variation in the biotic and abiotic factors
   responsible for explaining independent and collective climate change
   effects over a short time scale. Future work should consider the complex
   and non-additive relationships among factors of climate change and
   invasion in order to capture more ecologically relevant features of our
   changing environment.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine if there is a negative influence

   Although these flowers are produced during the whole year, we found a
   greater number of flowers in plants without galls, being that plants
   without galls showed approximately four times more flowers than plants
   with galls. The flowers length in plants without galls was greater than
   flowers in plants with galls. The flower biomass of the individuals
   without galls was also higher than in individuals with galls. The
   results are pursuant to the hypothesis that producing galls demands a

   the mile-a-minute weevil (Rhinoncomimus latipes Korotyaev). Moisture
   limitation and weevil herbivory significantly reduced the number of
   seeds produced by P. perfoliata, with the fewest seeds produced when
   both factors were present. Seed weight was reduced by moisture
   limitation and weevil herbivory the second year, and seed viability was
   reduced by herbivory both years. Plant biomass was lower both years
   under conditions of water limitation, with an additional effect of

Abstract = {{Studies of insect herbivory have mostly focused on leaf-feeding even
   though most woody plant biomass is stem tissue. Attack to stems has the
   potential to be more detrimental to plant performance than attack to
   leaves. Here we asked how severe is the impact of insect stem herbivory
   on plant performance. We quantify the effect of insect stem herbivory
   via a meta-analysis of 119 papers in 100 studies (papers by the same
   authors were treated as the same study). These studies involved 92 plant
   species and 70 species of insect herbivore (including simulated
   herbivory). Attack to plant stems reduced plant performance by an
   average of approximately 22\%. Stem herbivory had greatest impacts on
   plant and branch survival, which was reduced by 63\%. Measures of plant
   reproduction and vegetative biomass were reduced by 33\% and 16\%
   respectively, while measurements of photosynthetic rate were not
   significantly different between plants with and without stem herbivore
   attack. Stem herbivory led to a decline in leader performance but an
   increase in performance of laterals, highlighting the importance of
   plant compensation. Juvenile plants were more severely affected by stem
   herbivory than adult plants, and studies conducted in greenhouses found
   more severe effects than studies conducted in the field. Stem herbivory
   did not have a significant effects on any of the non-performance
   responses measured (defence compounds, SLA, root:shoot, phenology and
   plant carbon and nitrogen). We compare our results with results from
   various meta-analyses considering herbivory on other plant parts. The
   impact of insect herbivory to stems on plant performance appears at
   least as severe as insect herbivory to roots and leaves, if not more.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{471-478}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Herbivory can shape the dynamics of plant populations, including effects
   on survival and reproduction, and is in turn affected by environmental
   factors that vary in space and time. White-tailed deer are significant
   herbivores in North America that have been broadly documented to affect
   plant reproductive success. If variation in the frequency and impact of
   herbivory by deer correlates with a broad-scale latitudinal gradient,
   climactic effects may be important for shaping plant-herbivore
   interactions. Alternatively, a lack of broad-scale gradients would
   suggest local factors such as plant community composition and deer
   densities are affecting herbivory. To investigate broad-scale patterns
   of deer herbivory, we examined the frequency and reproductive
   consequences of deer browse over three years in 17 populations of
   Campanulastrum americanum spanning the latitudinal extent of its range.
   Even though deer are overabundant throughout the range of C. americanum,
   we found spatiotemporal variation in deer browse frequency (0-0.96, mean
   0.46) and its effects on plant reproductive success. The four
   southernmost populations experienced high levels of herbivory, and were
   responsible for generating a negative relationship between latitude and
   herbivory. In general, patterns of variation in the frequency and impact
   of herbivory across the entire latitudinal gradient pointed to the
   importance of local rather than broad-scale factors. Within a
   population, deer consumed larger plants. Across many populations and
   years, average fitnesses of browsed and uneaten plants were similar,
   suggesting that plants are tolerant to browse. However, since large
   plants have greater reproductive success and are more likely to be
   browsed, tolerance may be influenced by plant size. When plant size was
   accounted for, most populations did not fully compensate for browsing.
   There was no relationship between browsing intensity and tolerance,
   suggesting that browsing may be too variable to consistently select for
   tolerance, or that increases in deer density are too recent for
   increased tolerance to evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Coevolution is among the most important evolutionary processes that
   generate biological diversity. Plant pollinator interactions play a
   prominent role in the evolution of reproductive traits in flowering
   plants. Likewise, plant herbivore interactions select for myriad
   defenses that protect plants from damage. These mutualistic and
   antagonistic interactions, respectively, have traditionally been
   considered in isolation from one another. Here, we consider whether
   reproductive traits and antiherbivore defenses are interdependent as a
   result of pollinator- and herbivore-mediated selection. The evolution of
   floral traits, self-fertilization, and separate sexes frequently affects
   the expression and evolution of plant defenses. In turn, the evolution
   of defense can affect allocation to reproductive traits, and herbivores
   often impose strong selection directly on floral traits. Theory and
   empirical evidence suggest that herbivores can intluence the evolution
   of selling from outcrossing and potentially the evolution of separate
   sexes from combined sexes. We identify several areas in which future
   research is needed to increase our understanding of the evolutionary
   interplay between reproduction and defense in plants.}},

Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that slow-growing plants are more likely to
   maximize above-ground biomass and fitness when defoliated by herbivores
   than those with an already high relative growth rate (RGR). Some
   populations of the annual herb Datura stramonium L. can tolerate foliar
   damage better than others. The physiological basis of this difference is
   examined here in a comparative study of two ecotypes that differ in
   tolerance and maximum growth rate, using a growth analytical approach.
   One hundred and fifty-four plants of each ecotype grown under controlled
   conditions were suddenly defoliated (35 \% of total leaf area removed)
   and a similar sample size of plants remained undefoliated (control).
   Ontogenetic plastic changes in RGR and its growth components {[}net
   assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area and leaf weight ratio (LWR)]
   after defoliation were measured to determine whether these plastic
   changes maximize plant growth and fitness. Different ontogenetic phases
   of the response were discerned and increased RGR of defoliated plants
   was detected at the end of the experimental period, but brought about by
   a different growth component (NAR or LWR) in each ecotype. These changes
   in RGR are putatively related to increases in fitness in defoliated

   the ability to tolerate resource limitation due to defoliation.}},

Abstract = {{The degree to which biocontrol agents impact invasive plants varies
   widely across landscapes, often for unknown reasons. Understanding this
   variability can help optimize invasive species management while also
   informing our understanding of trophic linkages. To address these
   issues, we tested three hypotheses with contrasting predictions
   regarding the likelihood of biocontrol success. (1) The biocontrol
   effort hypothesis: invasive populations are regulated primarily by
   top-down effects, predicting that increased biocontrol efforts alone
   (e.g., more individuals of a given biocontrol agent or more time since
   agent release) will enhance biocontrol success. (2) The relative
   fertility hypothesis: invasive populations are regulated primarily by
   bottom-up effects, predicting that nutrient enrichment will increase
   dominance by invasives and thus reduce biocontrol success, regardless of
   biocontrol efforts. (3) The fertility-dependent biocontrol effort
   hypothesis: top-down effects will only regulate invasive populations if
   bottom-up effects are weak. It predicts that greater biocontrol efforts
   will increase biocontrol success, but only in low-nutrient sites. To
   test these hypotheses, we surveyed 46 sites across three states with
   prior releases of Galerucella beetles, the most common biocontrol agents
   used against invasive purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria).
   We found strong support for the fertility-dependent biocontrol effort
   hypothesis, as biocontrol success occurred most often with greater
   biocontrol efforts, but only in low-fertility sites. This result held
   for early stage metrics of biocontrol success (higher Galerucella
   abundance) and ultimate biocontrol outcomes (decreased loosestrife plant
   size and abundance). Presence of the invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea
   was also inversely related to loosestrife abundance, suggesting that
   biocontrol-based reductions in loosestrife made secondary invasion by P.
   arundinacea more likely.
   Our data suggest that low-nutrient sites be prioritized for loosestrife
   biocontrol and that future monitoring account for variation in site
   fertility or work to mitigate it. We introduce a new framework that
   integrates our findings with conflicting patterns previously reported
   from other biocontrol systems, proposing a unimodal relationship whereby
   nutrient availability enhances biocontrol success in low-nutrient sites
   but hampers it in high-nutrient sites. Our results represent one of the
   first examples of biocontrol success depending on site fertility, which
   has the potential to inform biocontrol-based management decisions across
   entire regions and among contrasting systems.}},

Abstract = {{Non-native invasive plants often lose many of their specialist
   herbivores in their invaded ranges, but new enemies may be recruited
   from the local generalist fauna, or from enemies themselves introduced
   to the same region. As a result, few invaders are free of herbivore
   damage; however, the incidence of this herbivory and its consequences
   for plant demography may depend on an array of biotic and abiotic
   factors. In Alliaria petiolata, a non-native invasive forb in Canada, we
   quantified the incidence of leaf herbivory, rosette survival and seed
   production along with conspecific plant density and environmental site
   conditions in wild populations in mesic forest understory and moist
   grasslands. We complemented the field survey by a laboratory experiment
   with Trichoplusia to test whether the palatability of leaf tissue of A.
   petiolata varies with plant life stage and habitat type. Incidence of
   herbivory was significantly higher in adults than in rosettes, and
   significantly higher in grasslands than in forest understory. The
   palatability experiment confirmed that leaves of adults were more
   palatable to a generalist herbivore than leaves of rosettes. Path
   analysis revealed negative plant density-dependent herbivory of adults
   in forest understory but positive density-dependent herbivory in
   grasslands. Incidence of herbivory in rosettes was positively associated

   production was significantly positively associated with herbivory in
   adults and soil moisture, whereas rosette survival was significantly
   negatively associated with conspecific plant density. We conclude that
   the patterns, determinants and demographic consequences of herbivory in
   invasive Alliaria may strongly depend on a plant's life stage and plant
   density and may further be confounded by landscape heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of primary producers is controlled by bottom-up and
   top-down forces. Despite the fact that there is consensus that the
   abundance of freshwater macrophytes is strongly influenced by the
   availability of resources for plant growth, the importance of top-down
   control by vertebrate consumers is debated, because field studies yield
   contrasting results. We hypothesized that these bottom-up and top-down
   forces may interact, and that consumer impact on macrophyte abundance
   depends on the nutrient status of the water body. To test this
   hypothesis, experimental ponds with submerged vegetation containing a
   mixture of species were subjected to a fertilization treatment and we
   introduced consumers (mallard ducks, for 8 days) on half of the ponds in
   a full factorial design. Over the whole 66-day experiment fertilized
   ponds became dominated by Elodea nuttallii and ponds without extra
   nutrients by Chara globularis. Nutrient addition significantly increased
   plant N and P concentrations. There was a strong interactive effect of
   duck presence and pond nutrient status: macrophyte biomass was reduced
   (by 50 \%) after the presence of the ducks on fertilized ponds, but not
   in the unfertilized ponds. We conclude that nutrient availability
   interacts with top-down control of submerged vegetation. This may be
   explained by higher plant palatability at higher nutrient levels, either
   by a higher plant nutrient concentration or by a shift towards dominance
   of more palatable plant species, resulting in higher consumer pressure.
   Including nutrient availability may offer a framework to explain part of
   the contrasting field observations of consumer control of macrophyte
   abundance.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental goal of ecology is to predict how strongly one species
   affects the abundance of another. However, our ability to do so is
   hindered by the fact that interaction outcomes are notoriously variable
   in space and time (i.e. context-dependent) and we lack a predictive
   understanding of the factors that drive this context-dependence.
   Determining whether abiotic factors, in particular, predictably shift
   the outcome of species interactions is of critical importance for many
   contemporary problems, from forecasting climate change impacts to
   predicting the efficacy of weed biocontrol. In this essay, we highlight
   the context-dependent nature of interactions between plants and their
   pollinators and herbivores. We advocate for approaches that will
   identify whether particular abiotic factors predictably shift how
   strongly these interactions influence plant abundance and/or population
   growth. We review long-standing theory that describes how abiotic
   context should influence the selective impacts of pollinators and
   herbivores on plants and articulate why this theory requires
   modification to predict population-level effects. Finally, we propose
   several empirical approaches to address gaps in existing knowledge: (i)
   experiments across broad abiotic gradients to determine whether the
   outcome of interactions between pollinators or herbivores and plants
   varies consistently with changing abiotic conditions; (ii) experiments
   that manipulate the underlying environmental gradient to elucidate
   whether the abiotic factor that correlates with interaction outcome is
   causal; and (iii) seed addition studies to explore how strongly seedling
   recruitment correlates with seed input (as affected by pollen limitation
   or herbivory) and to quantify how the strength of the seed-to-seedling
   linkage is influenced by the underlying abiotic gradient.Synthesis. Our
   understanding of the underlying drivers of context-dependent
   plant-animal interactions is currently not well developed. Progress in
   this area is essential to better predict when and where species
   interactions will alter the responses of plant populations to
   environmental changes as well as to develop more robust theory.
   Experiments aimed at explicitly exploring the role of abiotic factors in
   mediating the population-level impact of pollen limitation and herbivory
   could determine the extent to which variation in the abiotic environment
   predictably shifts the outcome of these interactions.}},

Title = {{Herbivore Impacts on Marsh Production Depend upon a Compensatory
   Continuum Mediated by Salinity Stress}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Plant communities are disturbed by several stressors and they are
   expected to be further impacted by increasing anthropogenic stress. The
   consequences of these stressors will depend, in part, upon the ability
   of plants to compensate for herbivory. Previous studies found that
   herbivore impacts on plants can vary from negative to positive because
   of environmental control of plant compensatory responses, a.k.a. the
   Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis. While these influential studies
   enhanced our appreciation of the dynamic nature of plant-herbivore
   interactions, they largely focused on the impact of resource limitation.
   This bias limits our ability to predict how other environmental factors
   will shape the impact of herbivory. We examined the role of salinity
   stress on herbivory of salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, by an
   herbivore previously hypothesized to influence the success of
   restoration projects (the scale insect, Haliaspis spartinae). Using a
   combination of field and mesocosm manipulations of scales and salinity,
   we measured how these factors affected Spartina growth and timing of
   senescence. In mesocosm studies, Spartina overcompensated for herbivory
   by growing taller shoots at low salinities but the impact of scales on
   plants switched from positive to neutral with increasing salinity
   stress. In field studies of intermediate salinities, scales reduced
   Spartina growth and increased the rate of senescence. Experimental
   salinity additions at this field site returned the impact of scales to
   neutral. Because salinity decreased scale densities, the switch in
   impact of scales on Spartina with increasing salinity was not simply a
   linear function of scale abundance. Thus, the impact of scales on
   primary production depended strongly upon environmental context because
   intermediate salinity stress prevented plant compensatory responses to
   herbivory. Understanding this context-dependency will be required if we
   are going to successfully predict the success of restoration efforts and
   the ecological consequences of anthropogenic disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the responses of ecological communities to perturbation is
   a key challenge within contemporary ecology research. In this study we
   seek to separate specific community responses from general community
   responses of plant communities to exclusion of large cervid herbivores.
   Cervid herbivory and forestry are the main drivers of vegetation
   structure and diversity in boreal forests. While many studies focus on
   the impact of cervids on trees, a high proportion of the biodiversity
   and ecosystem services in boreal forests is found in the field layer.
   However, experimental approaches investigating the influence of
   herbivory on understory vegetation are highly localised. In this study
   we use a regional-scale design with 51 sites in four boreal forest
   regions of Norway, to investigate the influence of cervid herbivory on
   the physical and ecological structure of field layer vegetation. Our
   study sites cover a range of forest types differing in productivity,
   management and dominant cervid species, allowing us to identify generic
   responses and those that are specific to particular conditions. We found
   that the height of the field layer and the abundances of individual
   species were most susceptible to change following short-term cervid
   exclusion across different forest types and cervid species. Total
   vegetation density and vascular plant diversity did not respond to
   cervid exclusion on the same time scale. We also found that the
   field-layer vegetation in clear-cut forests used by moose was more
   susceptible to change following cervid exclusion than mature forests
   used by red deer, but no strong evidence that the response of vegetation
   to herbivore exclusion varied with productivity. Our study suggests that
   the parameters that respond to cervid exclusion are consistent across
   forest types, but that the responsiveness of different forest types is
   idiosyncratic and hard to predict.}},

Volume = {{281}},

Abstract = {{The consumption of plants by animals underlies important evolutionary
   and ecological processes in nature. Arthropod herbivory evolved
   approximately 415 Ma and the ensuing coevolution between plants and
   herbivores is credited with generating much of the macroscopic diversity
   on the Earth. In contemporary ecosystems, herbivory provides the major
   conduit of energy from primary producers to consumers. Here, we show
   that when averaged across all major lineages of vascular plants,
   herbivores consume 5.3\% of the leaf tissue produced annually by plants,
   whereas previous estimates are up to 3.8x higher. This result suggests
   that for many plant species, leaf herbivory may play a smaller role in
   energy and nutrient flow than currently thought. Comparative analyses of
   a diverse global sample of 1058 species across 2085 populations reveal
   that models of stabilizing selection best describe rates of leaf
   consumption, and that rates vary substantially within and among major
   plant lineages. A key determinant of this variation is plant growth
   form, where woody plant species experience 64\% higher leaf herbivory
   than non-woody plants. Higher leaf herbivory in woody species supports a
   key prediction of the plant apparency theory. Our study provides insight
   into how a long history of coevolution has shaped the ecological and
   evolutionary relationships between plants and herbivores.}},

Title = {{Foliar functional traits that predict plant biomass response to warming}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{919-927}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Question: Ecologists are increasingly interested in making accurate
   predictions of plant response to climate change. Many studies have
   attempted to document plant response to warming by grouping species into
   functional groups. Within functional groups, however, species often
   display divergent responses. Determining how foliar functional traits
   might be used to predict plant responses to warming could reduce
   analytical complexity while maintaining generalizations across systems.
   Methods: We conducted ameta-analysis on 18 studies (consisting of 38
   species) of plant biomass response to experimental or natural warming.
   We determined whether plant trait estimates associated with the leaf
   economics spectrum {[}leaf life span (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA),
   leaf nitrogen (N-mass), leaf phosphorus (P-mass), photosynthetic
   capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance (G(s))] from a global plant
   database of experimentally unmanipulated plants, GloPNet, could be used
   to predict biomass response to experimental warming.
   Results: We found that three single leaf traits (LL, Nmass and Amax)
   were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming
   treatments, perhaps due to their association with plant growth rates,
   adaptation rate and ability, each explaining between 21-46\% of the
   variation in plant biomass responses. The magnitude of response to
   warming decreased with increasing LL, but increased with increasing
   Nmass and Amax. We found no linear combination of any of these traits
   that predicted warming response.
   Conclusions: These results show that foliar traits can aid in
   understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to temperature
   across species. Because each trait only explained a portion of variation
   in how plant growth responded to warming, however, future studies that
   examine how plant communities respond to warming should simultaneously
   measure multiple leaf traits, especially those most sensitive to
   warming, across plant species, to determine whether the predictive
   ability of functional traits changes between different ecosystems or
   plant taxonomic groups.}},

Abstract = {{1. The inherent complexity of nature produces a diverse and varied set
   of outcomes for any given ecological process. However, the advance of
   ecology requires making generalizations that synthesize current
   knowledge and guide new basic research and practical applications. Among
   the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis
   is one of the most accurate and powerful methods.
   2. This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received
   in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of
   synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant
   ecology from populations to ecosystems.
   3. The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing
   rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been
   accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper
   in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria
   specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to
   improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of
   meta-analyses.
   4. The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the
   advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other
   techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to
   demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large
   spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of
   variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory
   effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on
   communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of
   environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess
   research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g.
   landscape fragmentation).
   5. Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological
   theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and
   informing the scope of generalizations. However, plant ecologists can
   only take full advantage of this capacity if we improve our knowledge on
   how and when to conduct a proper meta-analysis, and by avoiding the
   frequent misuses that have characterized the use of this statistical
   tool in the ecological literature thus far.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species vary greatly in defenses against herbivores, but existing
   theory has struggled to explain this variation. Here, we test how
   phylogenetic relatedness, tradeoffs, trait syndromes, and sexual
   reproduction affect the macroevolution of defense.
   To examine the macroevolution of defenses, we studied 26 Oenothera
   (Onagraceae) species, combining chemistry, comparative phylogenetics and
   experimental assays of resistance against generalist and specialist
   herbivores.
   We detected dozens of phenolic metabolites within leaves, including
   ellagitannins (ETs), flavonoids, and caffeic acid derivatives (CAs). The
   concentration and composition of phenolics exhibited low to moderate
   phylogenetic signal. There were clear negative correlations between
   multiple traits, supporting the prediction of allocation tradeoffs.
   There were also positively covarying suites of traits, but these suites
   did not strongly predict resistance to herbivores and thus did not act
   as defensive syndromes. By contrast, specific metabolites did correlate
   with the performance of generalist and specialist herbivores. Finally,
   that repeated losses of sex in Oenothera was associated with the
   evolution of increased flavonoid diversity and altered phenolic
   composition.
   These results show that secondary chemistry has evolved rapidly during
   the diversification of Oenothera. This evolution has been marked by
   allocation tradeoffs between traits, some of which are related to
   herbivore performance. The repeated loss of sex appears also to have
   constrained the evolution of plant secondary chemistry, which may help
   to explain variation in defense among plants.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon and water cycling of forests contribute significantly to the

   ecosystem-scale physiological responses as well as impacts on carbon and
   water cycling in an Atlantic Coastal Plain upland oak/pine and upland

   leaf-level stomatal conductance was unchanged for pines but decreased
   for oaks, while canopy stomatal conductance decreased temporarily, but
   then rebounded the following growing season, thus exhibiting transient
   responses. This study suggests that forest response to disturbance

Abstract = {{Assessing the demographic effects of leaf area losses in perennial
   plants is important to determine population resilience to natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances. Yet, while impacts of defoliation on vital
   rates of adult plants have been well documented, consequences for seed
   dispersal and seedling recruitment have been barely explored.
   Here, we assessed the effects of defoliation on fruit production,
   fruit/seed size, seed dispersal and seedling recruitment in populations
   of Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii, a tropical rain forest, understorey
   palm from Mesoamerica, whose leaves are exploited as a highly valuable
   non-timber forest product (NTFP).
   Fruit size and seed production were quantified in mature palms that were
   subjected to 0\% (control), 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\% experimental
   removal of standing leaves, applied every 6months over 2years. Seed
   dispersal by birds and gravity, and seed predation by small vertebrates
   on the ground were also quantified. Rates of seedling recruitment were
   recorded in non-defoliated and `sterile' populations (75\% sustained
   defoliation and periodical removal of all produced fruits). Finally, a
   stochastic model was used to quantify the overall effect of defoliation
   on seedlings recruited from locally (i.e. dispersed by gravity) and
   immigrant produced seeds (i.e. dispersed by birds).
   Increasing defoliation strongly reduced seed production. The probability
   of bird dispersal was positively correlated with fruit/seed size.
   Isolated (i.e. bird-dispersed) seeds endured lower predation rates than
   grouped (i.e. gravity-dispersed) ones. Modelling showed that seedling
   recruitment rate is severely reduced in highly defoliated populations
   due to a strong decline in the number of seedlings coming from local
   seed sources. Surrounding non-defoliated populations could partly
   compensate for this effect via seedlings coming from immigrant seeds.
   Synthesis. Chronic and intense defoliation negatively affects seed
   production and dispersal, which reduces the probability of seedling
   recruitment. Such effects may have a profound impact on the dynamics and
   genetic variability of populations, which should be taken into account
   when considering the effects of natural defoliation and sustainability
   of leaf-harvesting regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the
   occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better
   understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree
   growth in order to predict the multi--factorial effect of climate change
   on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress
   interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that
   greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact
   of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies
   that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative
   study under real field conditions where we applied artificial
   defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (similar to 10 m
   high) maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Tree response to
   combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary
   growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the
   crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions,
   sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses
   were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress
   on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy
   partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced
   non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to
   drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water
   stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed,
   under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit
   the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also
   highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by
   defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found
   that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing
   season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active
   maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for
   tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease
   in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance
   under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation
   may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions between herbivores and natural enemies in
   fragmented landscapes is essential for conservation biological control.
   Studies including multiple enemies affecting multiple herbivores, plant
   damage and growth are needed. Here, we separated independent effects of
   (1) isolation of cherry trees from woody habitat and (2) the amount of
   woody habitat in the surrounding landscape (500 m buffers) on
   interactions between different groups of herbivores with their natural
   enemies and resulting changes in the growth of young cherry trees. Most
   predatory arthropods declined with habitat isolation, except some aphid
   predators (ladybeetles and hoverflies). Herbivores either increased with
   isolation (herbivorous beetles) or showed no significant response
   (aphids). In contrast, the amount of woody habitat in the landscape was
   not relevant for herbivore-enemy interactions at the investigated scale.
   Plant growth was affected by bottom-up (nutrient availability) and
   top-down (aphid density) forces but did not change significantly with
   habitat amount or isolation. We conclude that herbivores can be released
   from natural enemies at isolated sites, in accordance with the
   hypothesis that habitat connectivity improves pest control. However,
   each herbivore group responded differently to the landscape context and
   had contrasting effects on the same host plant, demonstrating the
   difficulty to predict landscape effects on plant growth. (C) 2014

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Soil nutrients, dormant axillary meristem availability, and competition
   can influence plant tolerance to damage. However, the role of potential
   bud banks (adventitious meristems initiated only after injury) is not
   known. Examining Central European field populations of 22 species of
   short-lived monocarpic herbs exposed to various sources of damage, we
   hypothesized that: (1) with increasing injury severity, the number of
   axillary branches would decrease, due to axillary meristem limitation,
   whereas the number of adventitious shoots (typically induced by severe
   injury) would increase; (2) favorable environmental conditions would
   allow intact plants to branch more, resulting in stronger axillary
   meristem limitation than in unfavorable conditions; and (3)
   consequently, adventitious sprouting would be better enabled in
   favorable than unfavorable conditions. We found strong support for the
   first hypothesis, only limited support for the second, and none for the
   third. Our results imply that whereas soil nutrients and competition
   marginally influence plant tolerance to damage, potential bud banks
   enable plants to overcome meristem limitation from severe damage, and
   therefore better tolerate it. All the significant effects were found in
   intraspecific comparisons, whereas interspecific differences were not
   found. Monocarpic plants with potential bud banks therefore represent a
   distinct strategy occupying a narrow environmental niche. The
   disturbance regime typical for this niche remains to be examined, as do
   the costs associated with the banks of adventitious and axillary reserve
   meristems.}},

Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Resource heterogeneity may influence how plants are attacked and respond
   to consumers in multiple ways. Perhaps a better understanding of how
   this interaction might limit sapling recruitment in tree populations may
   be achieved by examining species' functional responses to herbivores on
   a continuum of resource availability. Here, we experimentally reduced
   herbivore pressure on newly established seedlings of two dominant
   masting trees in 40 canopy gaps, across c. 80 ha of tropical rain forest
   in central Africa (Korup, Cameroon). Mesh cages were built to protect
   individual seedlings, and their leaf production and changes in height
   were followed for 22 months. With more light, herbivores increasingly
   prevented the less shade-tolerant Microberlinia bisulcata from growing
   as tall as it could and producing more leaves, indicating an
   undercompensation. The more shade-tolerant Tetraberlinia bifoliolata was
   much less affected by herbivores, showing instead near to full
   compensation for leaf numbers, and a negligible to weak impact of
   herbivores on its height growth. A stage-matrix model that compared
   control and caged populations lent evidence for a stronger impact of
   herbivores on the long-term population dynamics of M. bisulcata than T.
   bifoliolata. Our results suggest that insect herbivores can contribute
   to the local coexistence of two abundant tree species at Korup by
   disproportionately suppressing sapling recruitment of the faster-growing
   dominant via undercompensation across the light gradient created by
   canopy disturbances. The functional patterns we have documented here are
   consistent with current theory, and, because gap formations are integral
   to forest regeneration, they may be more widely applicable in other
   tropical forest communities. If so, the interaction between life-history
   and herbivore impact across light gradients may play a substantial role
   in tree species coexistence.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of increasing awareness that interactions between herbivory and
   the supply rates of multiple nutrients control biodiversity, ecosystem
   functions and ecosystem services in ecological communities, few
   experimental studies have concurrently examined the independent and
   joint effects of multiple nutrients and mammalian consumers on these
   responses in natural systems. Here we quantify the independent and
   interactive effects of multiple concurrent changes to resources and
   consumers in an invaded annual grassland community in California. In a
   two-year study using thirty-seven 400-m(2) plots, we examine
   interactions among four nutrient treatments (N, P, K and micronutrients)
   and a keystone herbivore (pocket gopher Thomomys bottae) on four plant
   community outcomes: 1) plant diversity, 2) functional group composition,
   3) net biomass production, an important ecosystem function, and 4)
   infection risk by a group of viral pathogens shared by crop and non-crop
   grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses), an important
   regulating ecosystem service. We found that grassland biodiversity and
   infection risk were controlled by nutrient identity and supply ratio
   whereas nutrients interacted strongly with consumers to control
   grassland composition and net primary productivity. The most important
   insights arising from this multi-factor experiment are that net biomass
   production increased with phosphorus or nitrogen supply; however, when
   gophers were present, nitrogen caused no net effect on biomass
   production. In addition, infection risk was driven by phosphorus,
   nitrogen and micronutrient supply. Infection in a sentinel host
   increased strongly with the addition of micronutrients or phosphorus;
   however, infection declined with increasing N/P supply ratio, indicating
   stoichiometric control of infection risk. Finally, in spite of
   manipulating multiple factors, plant species richness declined with
   nitrogen, alone. The importance of higher-order interactions
   demonstrates that a multi-factor approach is critical for effective
   predictions in a world in which anthropogenic activities are
   simultaneously changing herbivore abundance and the relative supply of
   many nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{In plants, compensatory growth takes place when the positive effects of

   Our objective was to evaluate the ability to compensate defoliation of
   Poa spicifbrmis, a forage perennial tussock grass in southern Patagonia
   (Argentina). The experiment was performed in potted plants that grew
   under controlled conditions of watering and fertilization. Three
   defoliation frequencies were imposed (zero, three or five) using 20-25
   day intervals among them. Harvest intensity was always equivalent to
   50\% of the aerial biomass. Fifteen plants were sampled per treatment,
   and growth and reproductive indicators were evaluated at the last
   sampling date. Differences between treatments were analyzed using ANOVA
   and orthogonal contrasts (p <0.05). Defoliation reduced the production
   of aerial, root and total biomasses between 48 and 53\%, indicating that
   there was not a total compensation. Frequency of defoliation only
   reduced plant height in the 5-cut treatment. Defoliation did not promote
   an increase in the number of tillers, and did not modify the number of
   reproductive culms. Poa spiciformis, presented partial compensation in
   the relative growth rate (RGR) only when the last harvest was performed
   at the time of low RGR on non-defoliated plants. Even when the species
   was not able to recover the removed biomass, the reproductive structures

Abstract = {{Climate change, in terms of both warming and altered precipitation, has
   the potential to affect grassland systems, with subsequent ramifications
   for grazing resources. Although grazing is the dominant land use in
   grasslands, little research has assessed how changes in climate might
   affect herbage quantity and quality, and how grazing intensity might
   influence these responses. We performed a fully controlled and factorial
   3-yr, multisite experiment simulating climate change and grazing (via
   clipping). This experiment was conducted at three northern temperate
   grassland sites across the Canadian prairies. We increased air
   temperature by 2 to 4 degrees C, reduced precipitation by 60\%, and
   clipped plants at low and high intensities. At one site, we also applied
   added (+60\%) precipitation. We monitored changes in herbage quantity
   (regrowth and accumulated herbage) and one aspect of herbage quality
   (protein content) for both graminoid and forb components. Both climatic
   factors (i.e., warming and reduced precipitation) and clipping decreased
   season-long accumulated herbage, with similar magnitudes of response to
   precipitation and clipping and smaller responses to warming. Regrowth
   biomass following clipping declined with reduced precipitation but had a
   limited decline with warming. Reduced precipitation and warming both
   decreased herbage quality, and clipping increased quality. These results
   indicate that the potential for losses in herbage production under
   drought and warming may be exacerbated by decreased herbage quality. We
   also saw evidence that graminoids, rather than forbs, will be more
   sensitive to climate changes. Our results further support the idea that
   planning for altered grazing resources under future climate conditions
   will be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of marine invaders on local biodiversity have not been analyzed
   across invasive species and invaded habitats. We conducted a
   meta-analysis of 56 field experiments published in 29 papers that

   typically have negative effects on biodiversity within a trophic level
   but positive effects on biodiversity of higher trophic levels. For
   example, both plants and sessile filter-feeders had positive effects on
   richness and diversity of mobile consumers. The contrasting negative and
   positive effects on similar versus higher trophic levels are potentially
   manifested through community-wide antagonism (competition and
   consumption) versus facilitation (habitat and food provisioning)
   interactions, respectively. These relation ships extended to functional
   interactions, as sessile invaders had negative effects on the
   biodiversity of sessile communities (intra-functional interactions) but
   positive effects on the biodiversity of mobile communities
   (inter-functional interactions). Our analyses highlight the importance
   of pairing attributes of the invader and the impacted organisms to
   obtain simple predictions of how the diversity of entire communities may
   respond to species invasions on local scales. We also note that our

   therefore considered important to evaluate nutrient-specific responses
   of E. crassipes to a grasshopper herbivore, Cornops aquaticum, prior to
   its release in South Africa. Both plant productivity and the response of
   E. crassipes to herbivory by C. aquaticum were nutrient dependent.
   Increases in plant biomass and leaf and ramet production were correlated
   with increases in nutrients in the water and plant biomass accumulation
   was reduced by herbivory at all three nutrient levels tested (high =
   67\%; medium = 100\%; low = 400\%). C. aquaticum nymphs fed E. crassipes

   vegetation. N-fertilization also enhanced the post-disturbance recovery
   of graminoids. Vegetation recovery was slow in the tundra heath, where
   N-fertilization decreased the abundance of the evergreen Empetrum nigrum
   ssp. hermaphroditum. Although the changes in vegetation due to the
   N-fertilization and disturbance could be detected, they did not change
   the initial dominance of plant functional types. Taken together, our
   results suggest that increasing N affects the rate rather than direction
   of recovery after disturbance. Moreover, plant communities differ in
   terms of their capabilities to respond to multiple perturbations which
   should be taken into account when evaluating future vegetation responses
   under changing environment in at high-latitude and high-altitude
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologically significant symbiotic associations are frequently studied
   in isolation, but such studies of two-way interactions cannot always
   predict the responses of organisms in a community setting. To explore
   this issue, we adopt a community approach to examine the role of
   plant-microbial and insect-microbial symbioses in modulating a
   plant-herbivore interaction. Potato plants were grown under glass in
   controlled conditions and subjected to feeding from the potato aphid
   Macrosiphum euphorbiae. By comparing plant growth in sterile,
   uncultivated and cultivated soils and the performance of M. euphorbiae
   clones with and without the facultative endosymbiont Hamiltonella
   defensa, we provide evidence for complex indirect interactions between
   insect- and plant-microbial systems. Plant biomass responded positively
   to the live soil treatments, on average increasing by 15\% relative to
   sterile soil, while aphid feeding produced shifts (increases in stem
   biomass and reductions in stolon biomass) in plant resource allocation
   irrespective of soil treatment. Aphid fecundity also responded to soil
   treatment with aphids on sterile soil exhibiting higher fecundities than
   those in the uncultivated treatment. The relative allocation of biomass
   to roots was reduced in the presence of aphids harbouring H. defensa
   compared with plants inoculated with H. defensa-free aphids and
   aphid-free control plants. This study provides evidence for the
   potential of plant and insect symbionts to shift the dynamics of
   plant-herbivore interactions.}},

   herbivory: A search for pattern}},
Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can facilitate nutrient uptake and
   increase host plant growth but also place constraints on the host's
   carbon budget. When plants are stressed by herbivory the net effect of
   the symbiosis may be altered tolerance. Individual experiments
   manipulating AM fungi and herbivory have demonstrated increased,
   decreased, and no effect on tolerance but patterns with respect to
   plant, herbivore, or fungus characteristics have not emerged.
   Meta-analysis of published results from factorial experiments was used
   to describe the size of the effects of herbivory and of AM fungi on host
   growth when factors such as cause of damage, inoculum, and host
   characteristics are considered, and to determine whether AM fungi alter
   the effects of herbivory. Also, the correlation between the effect of AM
   fungi on tolerance and resistance was tested with data from studies that
   examined insect performance. Herbivory strongly and consistently reduced
   shoot and root growth, especially in perennial plants and crops. AM
   fungi increased shoot growth of perennials but not annuals, and when
   insects caused damage but not when artificial defoliation was applied.
   Root growth was consistently greater with AM fungi. The interaction of
   AM fungi and herbivory, which indicates whether AM fungi alter the
   effects of herbivory, was variable and never significant overall but
   homogeneity tests indicated underlying structure. In experiments that
   used single species inoculum, Glomus intraradices increased, whereas
   Glomus mosseae reduced, effects of herbivory on shoot growth.
   Multispecies inocula magnified effects of herbivory on root growth
   whereas single species inocula ameliorated effects. The impact of AM
   fungi on resistance to herbivory was positively correlated with the
   impact on tolerance; however AM fungi reduced both tolerance and
   resistance in many cases. Review of these results with respect to the
   types of systems studied suggests directions for future investigation.

Title = {{Consequences of gene flow between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and its
   relatives}},
Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies have focused on the probability of occurrence of gene
   flow between transgenic crops and their wild relatives and the
   likelihood of transgene escape, which should be assessed before the
   commercial release of transgenic crops. This review paper focuses on
   this issue for oilseed rape, Brassica napus L, a species that produces
   huge numbers of pollen grains and seeds. We analyze separately the
   distinct steps of gene flow: (1) pollen and seeds as vectors of gene
   flow; (2) spontaneous hybridization; (3) hybrid behavior, fitness cost
   due to hybridization and mechanisms of introgression; (4) and fitness
   benefit due to transgenes (e.g. herbicide resistance and Bt toxin). Some
   physical, biological and molecular means of transgene containment are
   also described.
   Although hybrids and first generation progeny are difficult to identify
   in fields and non-crop habitats, the literature shows that transgenes
   could readily introgress into Brassica rapa, Brassica juncea and
   Brassica oleracea, while introgression is expected to be rare with
   Brassica nigra, Hirschfeldia incana and Raphanus raphanistrum. The
   hybrids grow well but produce less seed than their wild parent. The
   difference declines with increasing generations. However, there is large
   uncertainty about the evolution of chromosome numbers and recombination,
   and many parameters of life history traits of hybrids and progeny are
   not determined with satisfactory confidence to build generic models
   capable to really cover the wide diversity of situations. We show that
   more studies are needed to strengthen and organize biological knowledge,
   which is a necessary prerequisite for model simulations to assess the
   practical and evolutionary outputs of introgression, and to provide
   guidelines for gene flow management. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Disturbed natural areas frequently experience invasion by introduced
   plant species that can reduce native biodiversity. Biological control
   can suppress these introduced species, but without restoration another
   introduced species can invade. Integration of biological control with
   concurrent revegetation can both aid in weed reduction via interspecific
   plant competition and establish a restored native plant community. This
   3-year study investigated an integrated approach to controlling the
   introduced annual Mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata {[}L.] H.
   Gross {[}Polygonaceae]) using the biocontrol weevil Rhinoncomimus
   latipes Korotyaev (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and restoration planting
   using a native seed mix. A fully factorial design tested weevils and
   seeding, separately and together, using insecticide to eliminate
   weevils. The weevils together with the native seed mix reduced P.
   perfoliata percent cover in 2009 and 2010, and peak seed cluster
   production in 2010, compared to the insecticide-no seed control
   treatment. Persicaria perfoliata final dry biomass was reduced by 75\%
   in 2010 and by 57\% in 2011 in the weevils plus seed treatment compared
   to the control, with weevils having the greatest effect in 2010 and the
   seed treatment having the greatest impact in 2011. Results suggest an
   additive effect of biocontrol and seeding in suppressing P. perfoliata.
   Seeded treatments also developed the highest native plant species
   richness and diversity, comprised of spontaneous recolonization in
   addition to species from the seed mix. Results support the use of
   integrated management of this invasive weed, with suppression through
   biological control and native revegetation together helping prevent
   reinvasion while restoring native plant biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Tolerance and defence against herbivory are among
   the many mechanisms attributed to the success of invasive plants in
   their novel ranges. Because tolerance and defence against herbivory
   differ with the ontogeny of a plant, the effects of herbivore damage on
   plant fitness vary with ontogenetic stage and are compounded throughout
   a plants lifetime. Environmental stresses such as light and nutrient
   limitations can further influence the response of the plant. Much is
   known about the response of plants in the seedling and reproductive
   adult stages, but less attention has been given to the pre-reproductive
   juvenile stage.
   Methods Juvenile plants of the North American invasive Lonicera maackii
   were exposed to simulated herbivory under high and low light and
   nitrogen availability and growth, allocation patterns and foliar
   defensive chemistry were measured. In a second experiment, complete
   nutrient availability and damage type (generalist caterpillar or
   simulated) were manipulated.
   Key Results Juvenile plants receiving 50 defoliation had lower total
   biomass and a higher root boolean AND:boolean AND shoot ratio than
   controls for all treatment combinations except low nitrogen/low light.
   Low light and defoliation increased root boolean AND:boolean AND shoot
   ratio. Light, fertilization and defoliation had little impact on foliar
   defensive chemistry. In the second experiment, there was a reduction in
   total biomass when caterpillar damage was applied. The root boolean
   AND:boolean AND shoot ratio increased under low soil fertility and was
   not affected by defoliation. Stem-diameter growth rates and specific
   leaf area did not vary by damage type or fertilization. Foliar protein
   increased through time, and more strongly in defoliated plants than in
   controls, while peroxidase activity and total flavonoids decreased with
   time. Overall, resource limitations were more influential than damage in
   the growth of juvenile L. maackii plants.
   Conclusions The findings illustrate that even when resources are
   limited, the tolerance and defence against herbivory of a woody invasive
   plant in the juvenile stage may contribute to the establishment and
   persistence of some species in a variety of habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Introgression between transgenic, insect-resistant crops and their wild
   relatives could lead to a progressive increase of the frequency of
   resistant plants in wild populations. However, few studies help predict
   the impact on the population dynamics. To simulate the performance of
   introgressed insect-resistant plants of wild Brassica juncea,
   independently from the interspecific hybridization cost, healthy plants
   were cultivated in pure and mixed stands with damaged plants through
   cutting leaves in field experiments over two field seasons. As expected,
   resistant (healthy) plants held a competitive advantage when in
   competition with susceptible (damaged) plants. Individual biomass and
   seed production of both types of plants decreased as the percentage of
   resistant plants increased, so that the relative advantage of resistant
   plants increased. The combined effects of defoliation and competition on
   the individual performance of B. juncea were additive. Replacement
   series experiments confirmed this trend but did not show different seed
   output in pure stand of susceptible versus resistant plots. The total
   vegetative and reproductive production of mixed populations was not
   significantly different of that of pure populations. These results
   suggest that if a transgene for insect-resistance were to colonize wild
   populations, high herbivory of susceptible plant and low resource
   availability would facilitate the spread of resistant individuals.
   However, at the population level, the shift from an insect-susceptible
   to a predominantly resistant population would not result in exacerbated
   habitat colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Compensation, the degree of plant recovery after herbivory, is

   hypothesis (CCH) predicts that the more abundant the resources in an

   patches generated by leaf-cutting ants near their nests could modify

   experiment to evaluate the effects of refuse dumps (RDs) created by
   Acromyrmex lobicornis on plant compensation for foliar herbivory in
   roadside areas of the Patagonian steppe. We expected higher tolerance in
   plants growing in RDs than in adjacent non-nest soils (NNSs). We also
   assessed whether compensation differed between native and exotic species
   common in the area. We expected higher compensation in exotic than
   native plants since they perform better in RDs. Native and exotic plants
   fully compensated for simulated herbivory resembling natural levels. In
   the greenhouse, clipped plants achieved similar biomass as control
   plants and in the field reproductive output was similar between
   treatments. However, compensation was not higher in RDs than NNSs or in
   exotic than native plants as expected. Both native and exotic plants in
   roadside areas may have traits associated with disturbance which allow
   them to tolerate natural occurring herbivory without compromising their
   performance. Our study, the first one to test the CCH on RDs, shows that
   enhanced levels of resources do not always determine higher tolerance to

Abstract = {{While direct plant responses to global change have been well
   characterized, indirect plant responses to global change, via altered
   species interactions, have received less attention. Here, we examined
   how plants associated with four classes of fungal symbionts (class I
   leaf endophytes {[}EF], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi {[}AMF],
   ectomycorrhizal fungi {[}ECM], and dark septate endophytes {[}DSE])
   responded to four global change factors (enriched CO2, drought, N
   deposition, and warming). We performed a meta-analysis of 434 studies
   spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in
   responses of plant-fungal symbioses to future environments.
   Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal
   symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change? (2) Do fungal
   symbiont groups differ in the degree to which they modify plant response
   to global change? (3) Do particular global change factors affect
   plant-fungal symbioses more than others? In all global change scenarios,
   except elevated CO2, fungal symbionts significantly altered plant
   responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased
   plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N
   deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change
   factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the
   strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted
   gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and
   revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects
   of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of
   multiple fungal symbioses. Our results show that considering
   plant-fungal symbioses is critical to predicting ecosystem response to

Abstract = {{Feeding on above- and belowground plant tissues by Tipula paludosa
   Meigen during the period of rapid growth from second to forth instars is
   highly damaging to cool-season (C3) turfgrasses. It may be possible to
   reduce this damage by identifying grass genotypes that increase host
   plant protection. This study examined the impacts of plant genotype,
   endophyte infection, and plant ontogeny on host plant and insect
   responses during whole-plant feeding by T. paludosa. A series of
   no-choice greenhouse trials were conducted with third instar crane flies
   to determine 1) host plant tolerance in terms of reductions to above-
   and belowground plant biomass, 2) antixenosis resistance impacting
   insect behavior (emigration), and 3) antibiosis resistance impacting
   insect growth. Results showed that insect infestation level was the
   primary factor influencing plant biomass reductions. Belowground tissues
   were more tolerant to feeding than were aboveground tissues, with tall
   fescues, Festuca arundinacea Schreber, being most resistant to
   aboveground biomass reduction. Host plant associations with
   intercellular fungal endophytes (E+) decreased insect weight gain and
   decreased insect movement, but did not increase host plant tolerance.
   Plant ontogeny affected this response with insect weight gain
   significantly decreased on young (28 d) growth E+ grasses but not on old
   (90 d) growth E+ grasses, however. Host plant genotype and plant
   ontogeny can have significant impacts to host plant tolerance and insect
   physiology for T. paludosa larva. Furthermore, plant-endophyte
   associations have apparent sublethal effects that impact insect fitness

   P. populiella during most years and had little effect on herbivory by
   externally feeding invertebrates. By the end of the study, control
   ramets had suffered a reduction in height and girth relative to treated
   ramets and to the original, pretreatment size. Control ramets produced
   smaller leaves during some years and, after 7 years, produced fewer
   total shoots and leaves than ramets sprayed with insecticide. Treatment
   did not affect mortality, but at the warmer of the two sites, ramets
   sustaining ambient levels of leaf mining were significantly more likely
   to die back to basal sprouts than those treated with insecticide. We
   conclude that a decade of P. populiella outbreak has caused strongly
   negative effects on aspen development and the production of aboveground

Abstract = {{As the Earth's climate continues to change, drought and insect
   population outbreaks are predicted to increase in many parts of the
   world. It is therefore important to understand how changes in such
   abiotic and biotic stressors might impact agroecosystems. The plant
   stress hypothesis predicts that, owing to physiological and biochemical
   changes, plants experiencing drought will be more susceptible to insect
   herbivory, which could have synergistic negative effects on plant
   performance. By contrast, the plant vigor hypothesis predicts that
   insects will preferentially feed on fast-growing vigorous plants. These
   hypotheses were tested in a field experiment using 16 soybean (Glycine
   max (L.) Merr.) genotypes to determine: (i) the combined effects of
   drought and herbivory on plant performance; (ii) the impact of drought
   on soybean resistance to herbivores; and (iii) how genetically variable
   phenotypic traits in soybean correlate with these responses. It was
   found that drought had a greater effect on soybean performance than
   herbivory, and drought and herbivory did not interact to impact on any
   measure of plant performance. Drought caused decreased insect herbivory
   on average, suggesting that the plant vigor hypothesis is consistent
   with the effects of drought stress on soybean resistance to leaf-chewing
   insect herbivores. This conclusion is further supported by genotypic
   correlations which show that plant growth rate is positively correlated
   with the amount of herbivory plants received. These results suggest
   that, although the effects of climate-associated changes in drought and
   herbivory will have negative effects on soybean, these potential effects
   are quantifiable with simple experiments and can be mitigated through
   continued breeding of varieties that are tolerant and resistant to these
   abiotic and biotic stressors.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of herbivory on plant performance is the subject of a large
   number of ecological studies, and plant responses to herbivory range
   from reduced reproduction to overcompensation. Because plant defenses,
   stored resources, and allocation demands change throughout a plant's
   lifetime, it can be hypothesized the effects of herbivory also vary with
   development. The present work extends previous analyses to incorporate
   hundreds of studies in a new meta-analysis addressing this topic.
   Herbivores had an overall negative effect on plant growth and
   reproduction, and, in contrast to a previous meta-analysis, this work
   shows the timing of herbivory is relevant. Differences in the effects of
   herbivory between life stages existed for woody plant reproduction and
   perennial herb growth. In addition, tree and shrub growth was reduced by
   herbivore damage at early ontogenetic stages, and perennial herb
   reproduction was limited by adult stage herbivory. These results
   partially support the continuum of an ontogenetic response model.
   Finally, consideration of this synthesis in conjunction with other work
   led to the conclusion that different plant groups optimize their defense
   investments in unique ways. Slow-growing plants may strongly chemically
   defend young tissues, supporting the plant-age hypothesis, because early
   herbivory is detrimental to growth. Faster-growing herbs may invest more
   in antiherbivore defense when they are older, supporting the
   growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, because later herbivory
   limits their reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Early-season herbivory can cause plants to induce resistance to
   subsequent herbivores, and this ubiquitous plant defense strategy has
   been shown to be adaptive when subsequent vegetative-feeding herbivores
   impact plant fitness. However, a growing number of studies show that
   leaf herbivory can also induce defenses in plant reproductive tissues,
   which may deter mutualists such as pollinators and seed dispersers, or
   antagonists such as florivores and seed predators. Due to their direct
   interaction with plant reproductive tissues, deterrence of these
   mutualists or antagonists may have large negative or positive effects on
   plant fitness. Despite numerous predictions, we know little regarding
   the fitness consequences of leaf-to-reproductive tissue induction in
   nature. Here, using observations of natural populations and manipulative
   field experiments, we show that leaf herbivory by the invasive Japanese
   beetle (Popillia japonica) induces an accumulation of jasmonic acid and
   complex phenolics in reproductive tissues of the common evening primrose
   (Oenothera biennis). Consequently, seed predation by three native
   Lepidoptera is reduced by 77\% on beetle-induced plants, while leaf
   herbivory itself has little impact on lifetime reproductive output.
   These results show that O. biennis benefits from being consumed by an
   invasive folivore, and that leaf-to-reproductive tissue induction can be
   an adaptive trait. Induced plant defenses can therefore be beneficial in
   a broader community context than previously realized.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean acidification and warming are considered two of the greatest
   threats to marine biodiversity, yet the combined effect of these
   stressors on marine organisms remains largely unclear. Using a
   meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine
   organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation
   and combination. As expected biological responses varied across
   taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but
   importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger
   biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of
   orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological
   responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and
   survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and
   acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting
   stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from
   single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the
   development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that
   the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely
   to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward
   more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change

Abstract = {{Climate change is predicted to cause continued increases in global
   temperatures, greater variability in precipitation and in some cases,
   more frequent insect pest outbreaks. Here we seek to understand how
   abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change can affect
   plant-herbivore interactions in a model crop species (soybean, Glycine
   max (L.) Merr.) by answering three questions: (1) Do the combined
   effects of abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change
   cause synergistic negative effects on plant biomass? (2) Can abiotic
   stress affect resistance of plants to insect herbivores? (3) Does
   genetic variation in plant traits modify a plant's response to stress?
   We performed three experiments in controlled growth environments using
   up to 51 soybean genotypes selected to vary in numerous traits
   associated with drought and resistance against pests (e.g., insect
   herbivores, nematodes, and pathogenic fungi), and up to 3
   generalist-feeding herbivorous noctuid moth species (Helicoverpa zea,
   Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua) that commonly feed on
   soybean in North America. Drought and herbivory had the largest and the
   most consistent negative effects on plant performance, reducing the
   above- and below-ground biomass by 10-45 \%, whereas increased
   temperature had little to no effect on plants. Drought also increased
   susceptibility to generalist noctuid herbivores, but these results
   varied dramatically in magnitude and direction among plant genotypes.
   Our experiments show that the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on
   soybean biomass were largely due to the additive effects of these
   stresses, and there exists substantial genetic variation in the soybean
   germplasm pool we studied that could be used as a source of parental
   stock in breeding new crops that can more effectively tolerate and
   resist the combined negative effects of insect herbivory and drought.}},

   of consumers. This result held globally across 4years within plant

Abstract = {{The majority of angiosperms are hermaphroditic with total fitness

   most studies examining the effects of abiotic factors and species

   potentially biasing our understanding of the consequences of
   environmental factors on total fitness. Here, we use meta-analysis to
   test how environmental factors affect male function. We obtained 278
   effect sizes from 96 studies that measured male function responses to
   manipulated environmental factors. We found significant effects of
   abiotic factors and species interactions on estimates of male function,
   with responses varying depending on environmental factor identity. Male
   and female responses were correlated for abiotic factor manipulations,
   but varied based on the type of species interaction (antagonistic or
   mutualistic). This suggests that measuring only female function may
   misrepresent whole-plant reproduction depending on context. Finally, we
   found differences amongst components of male function in response to
   environmental factors, suggesting that some male function estimates may
   fail to capture the effects of environmental factors on male fitness.
   Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating male function

Abstract = {{Greater soil nutrients are thought to increase graminoid tolerance to
   herbivory (within-season regrowth following herbivore damage) by
   enabling new growth in response to defoliation, but these responses vary
   among graminoid species. We studied how two arctic graminoids,
   Eriophorum vaginatum (L.) in moist acidic tussock (MAT) tundra and
   Hierochloe alpina (Roem. \& Schult.) in dry heath (DH) tundra, tolerate
   both experimental and natural herbivory when fertilized with nitrogen
   and phosphorus. Fertilization reduced the tolerance and recovery
   (regrowth in subsequent years) of defoliated Eriophorum relative to
   plants growing without fertilization. In contrast, fertilized Hierochloe
   plants regrew well following defoliation. These opposing results may be
   due to differential abilities of these two species to access other
   resources in MAT and DH when fertilized. Herbivory may be affecting
   access to light of Eriophorum in the more productive, closed canopy MAT,
   in spite of its ability to grow bigger when fertilized. Hierochloe may
   not face such a limitation in the more open DH community. Alternatively,
   the different responses between these two species could be caused by
   environmental differences between the two communities. Regardless, our
   results suggest that although high tolerance is thought to be a

   caution must be exercised in predicting responses to herbivory within

Abstract = {{1. Herbivores and granivores represent one of the most influential
   drivers of plant abundance and population dynamics. Their effect can be,
   in turn, modulated by biotic or abiotic factors such as community
   composition, habitat characteristics or space heterogeneity.
   2. Recent approaches to the study of herbivore and granivore impacts on
   plants have considered the combined action of multiple herbivore
   species, the effect of herbivores on several plant life stages or the
   effect of environmental gradients on these interactions. However,
   studies addressing the effect of multiple herbivore species on different
   plant life stages are still lacking.
   3. We estimated the combined effect of multiple exotic herbivores
   (European rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus; black rats, Rattus rattus; and
   house mouse, Mus musculus) on four different life stages of an
   endangered plant species (Medicago citrina, Fabaceae). Mortality for
   seed, seedling and sapling was estimated at three types of plots (open,
   rat exclusion and rat + rabbit exclusion) replicated at four sites (N =
   3 per site and treatment) within Cabrera Island (Balearic Islands,
   western Mediterranean). Browsing of reproductive adults was simulated
   under common-garden conditions (Soller Botanic Garden, Mallorca Island)
   and its effect on reproductive effort and success measured.
   4. European rabbits and black rats had complementary impacts on the
   different life stages of M. citrina. These included independent effects
   on different life stages (seed predation by rats, seedling predation by
   rabbits), which resulted in multiplicative increases in plant mortality,
   and concurrent effects on the same life stage (sapling predation). In
   addition, the simulated-herbivory experiment showed that a low rate of
   canopy removal (25\% of initial biomass) already causes a strong
   decrease in fruit set (from 54\% to 30\%), but increasing rates of
   canopy removal do not increase this effect.
   5. Synthesis. Our results stress the importance of considering the
   combined effects of different herbivores on several life stages of the
   plant's life cycle and their consecutive effects on population dynamics.
   From an applied point of view, future reintroduction attempts of M.
   citrina in Cabrera Island should consider measures to either control the
   populations of both exotic herbivores or mitigate their impacts on the
   earlier recruitment stages of the plant (seeds, seedlings and saplings).}},

Abstract = {{The use of livestock to manage vegetation composition has become a

   Similar to many arid and semi-arid grasslands throughout the world,
   California grasslands have a history of invasion by non-native grasses
   and forbs. Attempts to restore native plant populations using managed
   grazing are common, despite the lack of an overarching quantitative
   basis for assessing livestock effects on different plant groups. Given
   the wide range of soils, climate and topography over which grasslands
   are found, it is important to understand the context-dependency of
   grazing effects across a region. We performed a meta-analysis of
   livestock grazing within California grasslands to investigate the
   response of different plant groups to grazing relative to precipitation,
   grassland type, soil and grazing regime. We found that exotic forbs
   showed a dramatic, uniform increase in cover with grazing, but no
   increase in richness. By contrast, native forbs increased in richness
   yet their cover response was weak and variable depending on grazing
   regime and precipitation. Exotic grass cover was unaffected while
   richness was enhanced by grazing. Native grass cover generally increased
   with grazing, although the high variation among studies was not
   predicted by the explanatory variables we evaluated. These results lend
   support to the use of grazing to enhance native forb richness and native
   grass cover in some settings although this must be weighed against
   increases in the cover of exotic forbs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Herbivore browsing on tree saplings is a common phenomenon that can
   cause damage particularly on preferred species. In this study, the
   combined effects of light availability and timing of browsing on the
   response of 9-year-old Abies alba saplings were tested experimentally.
   Leader shoot clipping was applied before budburst, shortly after
   budburst or in autumn on saplings grown in full light or under
   artificial shade. Timing of clipping, light availability and tree vigour
   (expressed as height and tree ring width before clipping) had an effect
   on the height after clipping. After clipping in autumn or before
   budburst, fast-growing fir saplings bent up twigs to form new leader
   shoots and overcompensated height loss; saplings characterised by
   intermediate growth rates formed new shoots out of regular visible
   lateral buds; and slow-growing saplings had no new shoot in the first
   year after clipping, such that the clipping-induced height difference
   even increased over time. Saplings clipped shortly after budburst
   elongated the remaining part of the shoot in the first year and
   developed shoots out of the most distal lateral buds in the second
   growing season, leading to complete height compensation. Multi-trunking
   was typical for all clipped trees. We conclude that the microscale
   conditions under which a tree is growing (i.e. which affect tree vigour)
   are highly important for determining whether the height reduction
   imposed by browsing is offset by overcompensation or increases over time
   relative to unclipped trees. This response can partly be influenced by
   forest management via enhancing tree vigour via the light regime.}},

   Simulated Caribou Browsing}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Densification of the shrub layer has been reported in many subarctic
   regions, raising questions about the implication for large herbivores
   and their resources. Shrubs can tolerate browsing and their level of
   tolerance could be affected by browsing and soils productivity,
   eventually modifying resource availability for the caribou. Our
   objective was to assess the compensatory growth potential of a subarctic
   shrub, Betula glandulosa Michx., in relation with caribou browsing and
   nutriment availability for the plants. We used a simulated browsing (0,
   25 and 75\% of available shoots) and nitrogen-fertilisation (0 and 10 g
   m 22) experiment to test two main hypotheses linking tolerance to
   resource availability, the Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis and the
   Growth Rate Hypothesis as well as the predictions from the Limiting
   Resource Model. We seek to explicitly integrate the relative browsing
   pressure in our predictions since the amount of tissues removed could
   affect the capacity of long-lived plants to compensate. Birches fully
   compensated for moderate browsing with an overall leaf biomass similar
   to unbrowsed birches but undercompensated under heavy browsing pressure.
   The main mechanism explaining compensation appears to be the conversion
   of short shoots into long shoots. The leaf area increased under heavy
   browsing pressure but only led to undercompensation. Fertilisation for
   two consecutive years did not influence the response of birch, thus we
   conclude that our results support the LRM hypothesis of equal tolerance
   under both high and low nitrogen availability. Our results highlight
   that the potential for compensatory growth in dwarf birch is surpassed
   under heavy browsing pressure independently of the fertilisation regime.
   In the context of the worldwide decline in caribou herds, the reduction
   in browsing pressure could act synergistically with global climate
   change to promote the current shrub expansion reported in subarctic
   regions. Citation: Champagne E, Tremblay J-P, Cote SD (2012) Tolerance

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aims As a consequence of global climate change, increases in the
   frequencies and severities of drought are anticipated for many parts of
   the world. Soil moisture and nitrogen (N) are among the major factors
   limiting grassland productivity. In pastures, N fertilizer returns by
   grazing animals are spatially and temporally heterogenous, and we
   therefore hypothesized that responses of plants and soil processes to
   drought may differ at the patch level.
   Methods Using rain-exclusion roofs, we simulated severe summer drought
   in a three-year field experiment replicated at two grassland sites
   contrasting in climate and management intensity. The study included a
   factorial N application treatment encompassing the application of cattle
   urine and mineral nitrogen. Responses of plants, soil microbes, and soil
   organic matter were assessed (carbon and nitrogen pools). N2O emissions
   were measured on 72 dates, and soil N2O concentration profiles on 44
   dates.
   Results Plant productivity responded negatively to drought and
   positively to N application. Interestingly, no or only small
   drought-effect were found on plant productivity when cumulated over the
   entire experimental duration, despite large effects during and shortly
   after the period when rain-exclusion roofs were installed. We further
   did not find evidence for compensatory growth after drought, and
   drought-effects did not differ between fertilizer hot spots and
   unaffected areas. In the short-term, soil microbial biomass responded
   positively to drought, but no long-term effects were detected. Nitrous
   oxide (N2O) emissions originated primarily from fertilizer hot spots,
   and these emissions were massively reduced under drought, with effects
   lasting throughout most of the growing season. On a growing season
   basis, N2O emissions were estimated to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude
   lower under drought.
   Conclusions Overall, our data suggest that even severe summer drought
   may have relatively little effect on plant productivity in the type of
   grassland and climate investigated, at least when considered on an
   annual basis. In contrast, drought may result in a large and sustained
   reduction of N2O emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Tolerance to herbivory (the degree to which plants maintain fitness
   after damage) is a key component of plant defense, so understanding how
   natural selection and evolutionary constraints act on tolerance traits
   is important to general theories of plant-herbivore interactions. These
   factors may be affected by plant competition, which often interacts with
   damage to influence trait expression and fitness. However, few studies
   have manipulated competitor density to examine the evolutionary effects
   of competition on tolerance. In this study, we tested whether
   intraspecific competition affects four aspects of the evolution of
   tolerance to herbivory in the perennial plant Solanum carolinense:
   phenotypic expression, expression of genetic variation, the adaptive
   value of tolerance, and costs of tolerance. We manipulated insect damage
   and intraspecific competition for clonal lines of S. carolinense in a
   greenhouse experiment, and measured tolerance in terms of sexual and
   asexual fitness components. Compared to plants growing at low density,
   plants growing at high density had greater expression of and genetic
   variation in tolerance, and experienced greater fitness benefits from
   tolerance when damaged. Tolerance was not costly for plants growing at
   either density, and only plants growing at low density benefited from
   tolerance when undamaged, perhaps due to greater intrinsic growth rates
   of more tolerant genotypes. These results suggest that competition is
   likely to facilitate the evolution of tolerance in S. carolinense, and
   perhaps in other plants that regularly experience competition, while
   spatio-temporal variation in density may maintain genetic variation in
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Drought and pests are primary abiotic and biotic factors proposed as
   selective filters acting on species distributions along rainfall
   gradients in tropical forests and may contribute importantly to species
   distributional limits, performance, and diversity gradients. Recent
   research demonstrates linkages between species distributions along
   rainfall gradients and physiological drought tolerance; corresponding
   experimental examinations of the contribution of pest pressure to
   distributional limits and potential interactions between drought and
   herbivory are limited. This study aims to quantitate differential
   performance and herbivory as a function of species range limits across a
   climatic and floristic transition in Southeast Asia. Khao Chong
   Botanical Garden, Thailand and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia straddle
   the Kangar-Pattani Line. A reciprocal transplantation across a
   seasonality gradient was established using two groups of species
   ({''}widespread{''} taxa whose distributions include seasonally dry
   forests and ``aseasonal{''} taxa whose distributions are limited to
   aseasonal forests). Growth, biomass allocation, survival, and herbivory
   were monitored for 19 months. Systematic differences in performance were
   a function of species distribution in relation to rainfall seasonality.
   In aseasonal Pasoh, aseasonal species had both greater growth and
   survivorship than widespread species. These differences were not a
   function of differential herbivory as widespread and aseasonal species
   experienced similar damage in the aseasonal forest. In seasonally dry
   Khao Chong, widespread species showed higher survivorship than aseasonal
   species, but these differences were only apparent during drought. We
   link this differential performance to physiological mechanisms as well
   as differential tolerance of biotic pressure during drought stress.
   Systematic decreases in seedling survival in aseasonal taxa during
   drought corresponded with previously documented physiological
   differences and may be exacerbated by herbivore damage. These results
   have important implications for tropical diversity and community
   composition in light of predicted increases in the frequency and
   severity of drought in hyperdiverse tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{Rain forest understorey perennial plants can be frequently exposed to
   leaf area losses induced by herbivory or physical damage from falling
   canopy debris. In dioecious species, tolerance to defoliation may differ
   between genders (e.g. females may suffer more than males), but this
   topic has so far received little attention. Here, we quantified
   gender-dependent effects of increased levels (0100\%) of sustained
   defoliation (applied bi-annually for 2 years) on vital rates in three
   economically important dioecious understorey palm species in the genus
   Chamaedorea (C. elegans, C. ernesti-augustii and C. oblongata). We also
   quantified gender differences in functional and life-history traits and
   assessed the direct reproductive costs in terms of biomass allocation to
   reproduction. In the three species, non-defoliated (control) females
   were smaller and had three to seven times higher reproductive allocation
   than males. Defoliation did not affect survivorship in any of the three
   species, except in the 100\% defoliation treatment. Stem growth (RGR)
   and especially reproduction (probability of reproduction and
   reproductive output) were negatively affected by defoliation. Females of
   C. ernesti-augustii suffered higher mortality than males at 100\%
   defoliation, but this was not the case for the other two species. Also,
   only in C. ernesti-augustii females exhibited lower RGR than males. In
   all species, the probability of reproduction did not differ between
   genders. The reproductive output (production rate of inflorescences)
   differed among genders only in C. ernesti-augustii, where males were
   more productive than females. Interestingly, in most cases, defoliation
   effects on vital rates did not differ significantly between males and
   females, indicating that tolerance to defoliation was similar between
   genders. Such results were independent of plant size (stem length).
   Synthesis. Our results do not support the prevailing theory that the
   greater reproductive costs of females will lead to reduced tolerance to
   stresses such as defoliation. The implications of these results and
   their importance for designing sustainable leaf harvesting regimes are
   discussed.}},

   endangered plant at three sites: two were protected areas where
   introduced and feral ungulates are present, and the other one was a
   non-protected site without introduced ungulates. We found that adults
   and saplings were more abundant at the non-protected site. Through
   matrix models, we also highlighted that the non-protected population
   showed the highest population growth rate. Finally, by means of an
   exclusion experiment for ungulates at one protected site, we
   demonstrated that herbivores had a negative effect on the survival of
   seedlings and adult plants, and reduced the stochastic population growth
   rate. An LTRE analysis showed that differences in the survival,

   explaining the higher population growth rate when herbivores are
   excluded. Our study constitutes a clear example on how the protection of
   alien large herbivores can have opposite effects on the conservation of

Abstract = {{Plant compensatory regrowth is an induced process that enhances plant
   tolerance to herbivory. Plant behavior against herbivores differs
   between species and depends on resource availability, thus making
   general predictions related to plant compensatory regrowth difficult. To
   understand how soil nutrients determine the degree of compensatory
   regrowth for different plant species, we selected saplings of three
   Ficus species and treated with herbivore insects and artificial injury
   in both glasshouse conditions and in the field at two soil nutrient
   levels. Compensatory regrowth was calculated by biomass, relative growth
   rate and photosynthetic characteristics. A similar pattern was found in
   both the glasshouse and in the field for species F. hispida, where
   overcompensatory regrowth was triggered only under fertile conditions,
   and full compensatory regrowth occurred under infertile conditions. For
   F. auriculata, overcompensatory regrowth was stimulated only under
   infertile conditions and full compensatory regrowth occurred under
   fertile conditions. Ficus racemosa displayed full compensatory regrowth
   in both soil nutrient levels, but without overcompensatory regrowth
   following any of the treatments. The three Ficus species differed in
   biomass allocation following herbivore damage and artificial injury. The
   root/shoot ratio of F. hispida decreased largely following herbivore
   damage and artificial injury, while the root/shoot ratio for F.
   auriculata increased against damage treatments. The increase of shoot
   and root size for F. hispida and F. auriculata, respectively, appeared
   to be caused by a significant increase in photosynthesis. The results
   indicated that shifts in biomass allocation and increased photosynthesis
   are two of the mechanisms underlying compensatory regrowth. Contrasting
   patterns among the three Ficus species suggest that further theoretical
   and empirical work is necessary to better understand the complexity of
   the plant responses to herbivore damage.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to tolerate, or compensate for, herbivore damage
   is highly variable and has been the subject of much research. Although
   many plants can compensate for herbivore damage, and some even
   overcompensate, we cannot yet generalize about the conditions that
   promote a positive response to damage. Here, we asked how abiotic
   resources (i.e. plant nutrient status) coupled with biotic interactions
   i.e. subsequent interactions with pollinators, seed predators and nectar
   robbing bumble bees affect the compensatory ability of Ipomopsis
   aggregata, a monocarpic herb that has been the subject of much previous
   debate. We hypothesized that compensation to herbivore damage in I.
   aggregata (Polemoniaceae) would depend first on plants having an ample
   supply of resources and, second, on the outcome of subsequent
   interactions with mutualist pollinators and enemy pre-dispersal seed
   predators and nectar robbing bumble bees. We used a fully-factorial
   experiment in which plants were watered, fertilized or left as
   unmanipulated controls, crossed with clipping to simulate herbivore
   damage to the apical meristem. Resource addition enhanced both male and
   female components of fitness, but resource enhancement did not provide
   the means for plants to fully compensate for simulated herbivory.
   Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences, but at the
   expense of a delay in flowering and fewer total flowers. Clipping
   significantly reduced losses to dipteran pre-dispersal seed predators by
   delaying flowering time, but early flowering plants produced higher
   numbers of seeds despite incurring higher rates of predation. Clipped
   plants incurred a higher risk to nectar robbers in one of two years.
   Overall, clipped plants suffered severe reductions (a nearly 50\%
   reduction in total seed set) in female success, but clipping combined
   with nutrient addition enhanced male function through increases in
   per-flower pollen production. However, because clipped plants produced
   significantly fewer flowers than unclipped plants, whole-plant pollen
   production was significantly reduced by clipping. Pollinator visitation
   and nectar robbing were variable between clipping treatments and between
   years and (nectar robbing) among sites. Our results demonstrate that the
   variability in plant response to herbivory can, at least in part, be
   driven by plant interactions with mutualists and enemies. Thus,
   accounting for such interactions and their variability is important to
   fully understanding plant compensation for herbivore damage and will
   likely go far to explain variation in plant response that appears to be
   independent of resources.}},

Abstract = {{1. Perennial plants often endure chronic loss of leaf area due to
   recurrent physical damage, herbivory and, for species used as non-timber
   forest products, due to leaf harvesting. However, little is known about
   functional and demographic resilience (extent and speed of recovery) of
   plants subjected to varying levels of chronic defoliation. 2. We used a
   dioecious, understorey palm (Chamaedorea elegans) to evaluate temporal
   trajectories and rates of recovery of leaf functional traits and vital
   rates (survival, growth and reproduction) after being subjected to
   experimental chronic defoliation regimes. 3. Pristine populations of
   mature C. elegans, categorized by gender (male and female), were
   subjected to five defoliation levels (0\%, 33\%, 50\%, 66\% or 100\% of
   newly produced leaves) every 6 months over a period of 3 years
   (19972000). To evaluate recovery from defoliation, surviving palms were
   monitored for 3 years after the cessation of the defoliation treatment
   (20002003). We recorded leaf functional traits (leaf persistence, leaf
   production rate, leaf size and leaf area) and annual rates of mortality,
   growth and reproduction. 4. Cumulative effects of chronic defoliation
   concomitantly reduced leaf traits, survival, growth and reproduction,
   and this effect was stronger in female than in male palms, independent
   of plant size. Recovery from defoliation was faster in males than in
   females, but proceeded gradually overall. Survival increased first,
   followed by growth, while reproductive traits showed the slowest
   recovery rate. Recovery was independent of plant size. Notably, 3 years
   after defoliation treatment, the standing leaf area and probability of
   reproduction had not recovered to pre-defoliation levels. Additionally,
   we found that the occurrence of a severe drought in the first year
   (2000) after defoliation ceased led to decreased survival, growth and
   reproduction and the ability of plants to recover from defoliation. 5.
   Synthesis. Chronic defoliation reduces fitness components of C. elegans
   palms differentially between genders. Recovery is gradual and is slower
   and less complete in females compared with males. The lower level of
   resilience to chronic defoliation shown by female plants may have
   profound consequences for the dynamics and genetic variability of
   populations of tropical understorey plants undergoing prolonged
   defoliation. Such effects may be aggravated by severe drought episodes
   that are expected to increase in frequency according to global climate
   change predictions.}},

   total protease, trypsin-like enzymes, and weak and active alkaline
   trypsin-like enzymes increased in the midgut of H. armigera when fed on
   WT plants grown under elevated CO2. Unexpectedly, the tolerance of the
   WT to H. armigera (in terms of photosynthetic rate, activity of sucrose
   phosphate synthases, flower number, and plant biomass and height) was
   also reduced by elevated CO2. Under ambient CO2, the expression of
   resistance and tolerance to H. armigera was much greater in wild type
   than in spr2 (a JA-deficient genotype) plants, but elevated CO2 reduced
   these differences of the resistance and tolerance between WT and spr2
   plants. The results suggest that the JA signaling pathway contributes to
   both plant resistance and tolerance to herbivorous insects and that by
   suppressing the JA signaling pathway, elevated CO2 will simultaneously
   reduce the resistance and tolerance of tomato plants.}},

Abstract = {{1. Determining the drivers of plant demography is integral to
   understanding the processes that shape plant species abundances and
   distributions. Despite recognition that interactions among drivers have
   important effects on demographic processes, few demographic studies test
   for interactions among multiple drivers in plants. 2. We used a
   factorial-design experiment to study the interactive effects among three
   common forms of disturbance in the tropics (fire history, grazing and
   leaf harvest by humans) on the vital rates of Phoenix loureiri (mountain
   date palm) in South India. In addition, we tested for interactive
   effects among these disturbances, abiotic conditions and plant size. We
   also tested for non-consumptive effects of grazing and harvest, such as
   trampling, by measuring the intensities of grazing and harvest in plots
   open to these disturbances. 3. Intensities of leaf harvest and grazing
   varied with abiotic conditions and disturbance. Leaf harvest decreased
   with increasing grazing intensity, suggesting that the net effect of
   harvest on palm populations is less where it co-occurs with grazing. In
   areas without fire, plots with lower soil moisture had higher grazing
   intensities. 4. We found multiple significant main and interactive
   effects of disturbance on palm vital rates. Palm mortality increased
   with fire and grazing. Grazing and harvest reduced growth, but growth
   increased following fire. The negative impact of harvest on palm
   individuals was reduced when harvest occurred in plots with fire. 5. We
   found evidence of non-consumptive effects of grazing and harvest on palm
   growth, likely from trampling. Studies inferring the effects of grazing
   by comparing grazed and ungrazed individuals within an area where
   grazing occurs will likely underestimate grazing effects. 6. Synthesis.
   Our findings reveal that P. loureiri demographic rates are driven by
   interactive effects among multiple forms of disturbance and abiotic
   factors and that the intensities of disturbance are themselves driven by
   interactions between other forms of disturbance and abiotic factors.
   These results illustrate that understanding the effects of, and
   interactions among, multiple drivers will be key in attempts to mitigate
   the effects of environmental change on plant species declines.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in belowground herbivory and the remarkable diversity
   of the accumulated information on this topic inspired us to
   quantitatively explore the variation in the outcomes of individual
   studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of 85 experimental studies
   reporting the effects of root-feeding insect herbivores (36 species) on
   plants (75 species). On average, belowground herbivory led to a 36.3\%
   loss of root biomass, which was accompanied by a reduction in
   aboveground growth (-16.3\%), photosynthesis (-11.7\%) and reproduction
   (-15.5\%). The effects of root herbivory on aboveground plant
   characteristics were significant in agricultural and biological control
   studies, but not in studies of natural systems. Experiments conducted in
   controlled environments yielded larger effects on plants than field
   experiments, and infestation experiments resulted in more severe effects
   than removal studies employing natural levels of herbivory. Simulated
   root herbivory led to greater aboveground growth reductions than similar
   root loss imposed by insect feeding. External root chewers caused
   stronger detrimental effects than sap feeders or root borers; specialist
   herbivores imposed milder adverse effects on plants than generalists.
   Woody plants suffered from root herbivory more than herbaceous plants,
   although root loss was similar in these two groups. Evergreen woody
   plants responded to root herbivory more strongly than deciduous woody
   plants, and grasses suffered from root herbivory more than herbs.
   Environmental factors such as drought, poor nutrient supply, among-plant
   competition, and aboveground herbivory increased the adverse effects of
   root damage on plants in an additive manner. In general, plant tolerance
   to root herbivores is lower than tolerance to defoliating aboveground
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat corridors confer many conservation benefits by increasing
   movement of organisms between habitat patches, but the benefits for some
   species may exact costs for others. For example, corridors may increase
   the abundance of consumers in a habitat to the detriment of the species

   insect herbivory of a native plant, Solanum americanum, in large-scale,
   experimentally fragmented landscapes. We quantified leaf herbivory and
   assessed fruit production as a proxy for plant fitness. We also
   conducted field surveys of grasshoppers (Orthoptera), a group of
   abundant, generalist herbivores that feed on S. americanum, and we used
   exclosure cages to explicitly link grasshopper herbivory to fruit
   production of individual S. americanum. The presence of corridors did
   not increase herbivory or decrease plant fruit production. Likewise,
   corridors did not increase grasshopper abundance. Instead, patches in
   our landscapes with the least amount of edge habitat and the greatest
   amount of warmer ``core'' area had the highest levels of herbivory, the
   largest cost to plant fruit production as a result of herbivory, and the
   most grasshoppers. Thus habitat quality, governed by patch shape, can be
   more important than connectivity for determining levels of herbivory and
   the impact of herbivory on plant fitness in fragmented landscapes.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{1 Aphid population dynamics in crops are often driven by interactions
   with their host plants, which can be extensively influenced by
   environmental change. Protective environments (i.e. plastic tunnels) are
   now frequently used for soft fruit production, which may affect the
   localized climate and alter such interactions. This two year study on
   red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) addressed how protected environments
   affected two aphid species; the large raspberry aphid Amphorophora idaei
   (LRA) and the small raspberry aphid Aphis idaei (SRA). 2 Temperatures
   were higher (up to 710 degrees C) in tunnels compared with the field.
   Plants in tunnels grew approximately 1.4 cm/week faster and had lower
   (approximately 35\%) foliar amino acid concentrations than plants in the
   field. 3 Aphids affected plant growth differently depending on growing
   environment; they promoted plant growth by 1837\% in tunnels, although
   they had no such effect in the field. Aphids reduced total and essential
   amino acid concentrations, with SRA causing greatest reductions
   (approximately 40\% and 33\%, respectively). 4 Aphid population sizes
   were similar in both environments, although individual LRA were smaller
   in tunnels (30\% smaller in 2007) compared with those in the field. We
   suggest that faster aphid development rates inside warmer tunnels were
   not realized as a result of the variable effects of the growing
   environment on amino acid composition. 5 We conclude that the increasing
   use of protected environments in crop production will not necessarily
   cause predictable increases in aphid populations, although it may alter
   aphidplant interactions in terms of aphid-induced changes to plant
   growth.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant plastic responses to herbivore damage may include rapid, active
   reallocation of plant resources to reduce the impact of herbivory on
   future plant fitness. However, whether these inducible tolerance
   responses can be extended to pine trees and how these responses could be
   modulated by genetic and environmental factors remains unclear.
   2. Biomass allocation and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations
   in above-and below-ground tissues were measured in Pinus pinaster
   juveniles belonging to 33 open-pollinated families grown under two P
   availabilities (P-deficient and complete fertilization). Measurements
   were taken 15 days after half of the plants received a foliar spray
   treatment of 22 mmol L-1 methyl jasmonate (MJ) to simulate above-ground
   herbivore attack.
   3. Simulated above-ground herbivory promoted a strong preferential
   allocation of biomass below ground in the form of fine roots, leading to
   an almost two-fold increase in fine root biomass in MJ-treated plants
   and a significant reduction in above-ground tissues and coarse roots. In
   addition, MJ signalling increased P and N concentrations in the shoots
   while reducing (P) or maintaining (N) concentrations in the roots. These
   results suggest that induced resource sequestration is not a generalized
   strategy in this pine species. Fine root biomass and concentration of N
   and P in plant tissues showed additive genetic variation, but responses
   to MJ signalling did not vary among families. Allocation of biomass to
   fine roots was not affected by P availability, whereas allocation of P
   to the shoot was more intense under complete fertilization.
   4. Synthesis: Two new putative tolerance mechanisms inducible by MJ
   signalling may help to minimize the impact of above-ground herbivore
   damage on the future fitness of young pine trees by (i) allocation of
   carbon to fine roots, this appeared to be a generalized strategy with
   weak environmental modulation and (ii) reallocation of P and N from
   roots to shoots, which was largely affected by P availability, and thus
   susceptible to greater phenotypic variation in heterogeneous
   environments. We provide evidence that changes in tolerance-related
   traits are rapidly inducible by herbivory cues in this pine species.
   These results should be integrated with induced resistance responses to
   fully understand the costs and benefits associated with induced
   responses to herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid evolutionary changes in invasion-related ecological traits of
   alien plants are receiving considerable attention in current ecological
   research. Tolerance to herbivory is of particular interest because of
   the potential for using biological agents to control the spread of
   invasive plants. In this study, we compared herbivory tolerance in six
   populations of tall form Spartina alterniflora: three from its
   introduced range in Jiangsu Province, China, and three from its native
   range in Georgia, USA. Plants were grown in a greenhouse and subjected
   to a full-factorial experimental design with three simulated leaf
   herbivory levels and two levels of nitrogen availability for 20 weeks.
   We found that native and invasive tall form S. alterniflora grown under
   different nitrogen conditions responded to simulated leaf herbivory
   differently with regard to underground and aboveground biomass and total
   culm height. Invasive S. alterniflora populations had a greater capacity
   to compensate for leaf damage than native populations in terms of
   underground biomass and aboveground biomass, particularly with low
   nitrogen availability. In addition, invasive S. alterniflora also showed
   higher compensatory capacity than native plants with regard to total
   culm height in both nitrogen treatments and with regard to tiller number
   in the high nitrogen treatment Elevated nitrogen availability
   significantly increased the compensatory capacity of underground biomass
   in native S. alterniflora populations but did not affect any factor in
   invasive populations. Our results suggested a rapid evolutionary change
   in herbivory tolerance of invasive tall form S. alterniflora after its

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{1. In ecological webs, net indirect interactions between species are
   composed of interactions that vary in sign and magnitude. Most studies
   have focused on negative component interactions (e.g. predation,
   herbivory) without considering the relative importance of positive
   interactions (e.g. mutualism, facilitation) for determining net indirect
   effects.
   2. In plant/arthropod communities, ants have multiple top-down effects
   via mutualisms with honeydew-producing herbivores and harassment of and
   predation on other herbivores; these ant effects provide opportunities
   for testing the relative importance of positive and negative
   interspecific interactions. We manipulated the presence of ants,
   honeydew-producing membracids and leaf-chewing beetles on perennial host
   plants in field experiments in Colorado to quantify the relative
   strength of these different types of interactions and their impact on
   the ant's net indirect effect on plants.
   3. In 2007, we demonstrated that ants simultaneously had a positive
   effect on membracids and a negative effect on beetles, resulting in less
   beetle damage on plants hosting the mutualism.
   4. In 2008, we used structural equation modelling to describe
   interaction strengths through the entire insect herbivore community on
   plants with and without ants. The ant's mutualism with membracids was
   the sole strong interaction contributing to the net indirect effect of
   ants on plants. Predation, herbivory and facilitation were weak, and the
   net effect of ants reduced plant reproduction. This net indirect effect
   was also partially because of behavioural changes of herbivores in the
   presence of ants. An additional membracid manipulation showed that the
   membracid's effect on ant activity was largely responsible for the ant's
   net effect on plants; ant workers were nearly ten times as abundant on
   plants with mutualists, and effects on other herbivores were similar to
   those in the ant manipulation experiment.
   5. These results demonstrate that mutualisms can be strong relative to
   negative direct interspecific interactions and that positive
   interactions deserve attention as important components of ecological
   webs.}},

Abstract = {{In African savannas, abandonment of traditional livestock corrals

   time on these sites in clay-rich ``black cotton{''} soils or how
   herbivores attracted to these sites affect vegetation development. I
   first examined whether treeless ``glades{''}, derived from abandoned
   bomas, function as nutrient and herbivore hotspots. Soil, vegetation,
   and herbivore data were collected on glades of varying ages. The results
   indicated that glades persist as long-term (>= four decades) patches
   (0.25-1.0 ha) of improved soil texture and increased nutrient levels,
   palatable grasses, and herbivore use. Glade vegetation also appears to
   undergo succession from Cynodon plectostachyus to Pennisetum stramineum
   dominance. Based on these patterns, exclusion cages were used to test
   herbivore effects on glade vegetation development. I found that large
   herbivores may retard succession by suppressing invasion of P.
   stramineum into C. plectostachyus-dominated areas. These results provide
   evidence that abundant anthropogenic glades function as long-term
   nutrient and wildlife hotspots in black cotton soils, distinct from
   similar hotspots in other soil types. The findings provide evidence that
   large herbivores can exert control over development and persistence of
   glades through their effects on plant community dynamics. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{During the last 25 yr, Sami reindeer husbandry in parts of
   Finnmarksvidda in the Norwegian Arctic has been in a critical state
   because of overexploitation of lichen-dominated tundra, which serves as
   winter forage. To better understand the ecosystem's capabilities for
   recovery we investigated vegetation cover changes over a 7-yr period,
   starting in 1998, at 52 sites dispersed over a large area at
   Finnmarksvidda. Two types of plots were established: one fenced from
   reindeer grazing and trampling and one open for reindeer. The
   investigations in 2005 showed that lichen cover had had a significant
   and rapid increase (up to 8.6-fold per year). The cover of vascular
   plants, mainly dwarf shrubs, also increased significantly, while barren
   areas and the cover of litter decreased significantly during the period.
   Mean relative growth rate of lichen biomass was 0.083 +/- 0.011 per year
   in open plots, which is considered very rapid recovery compared to
   previous studies. Lichen recovery was significantly faster on leeward
   ridges than on exposed ridges, and fencing alone did not have any
   significant effects on lichen recovery, but in interaction with time,
   fencing contributed to increasing recovery rates. The lichen heath
   recovery was reciprocally correlated with reindeer density. In addition,
   lichen recovery was probably facilitated by recent climate changes, viz,
   shallower snow depths which made leeward tundra and forest floor
   vegetation accessible for reindeer, and increased summer precipitation
   rates which improved growth rates. The results from this study show that
   in a very short time there was a transition from an overexploited
   depauperate vegetation and barren ground state to a flourishing
   lichen-dominated vegetation state, suggesting that the injuries were
   repairable. The vegetation transitions which have taken place in the
   study area are considered to be reversible with fewer persistent

   investment in root biomass in the absence of damage. In addition,
   defoliated plants produced shorter-lived leaves and had a greater

Abstract = {{Large mammalian herbivores manifest a strong top-down control on

   evaluate the effects of plant biomass consumption by large mammalian

   these herbivores, on carbon stocks in temperate and tropical regions,
   and the Arctic. We calculate the difference in carbon stocks resulting
   from herbivore exclusion using the results of 108 studies from 52
   vegetation types. Our estimates suggest that herbivores can reduce
   terrestrial above- and below-ground carbon stocks across vegetation
   types but reductions in carbon stocks may approach zero given sufficient
   periods of time for systems to respond to herbivory (i.e. decades). We
   estimate that if all large herbivores were removed from the vegetation

   carbon levels in many regions, including those with high herbivore
   densities, and upwards revisions of our estimates may be necessary. Our
   results provide a starting point for a discussion on the magnitude of
   the effects of herbivory on the global carbon cycle, particularly given
   that large herbivores are common in many ecosystems. We suggest that
   herbivore removal might represent an important strategy towards
   increasing terrestrial carbon stocks at local and regional scales within
   specific vegetation types, since humans influence populations of most
   large mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Severe damage often provokes compensatory resprouting of plants, which
   commonly modify plant morphological and phenological traits. Rapid plant
   growth often results in poorly defended nutrient-rich foliage, which is
   more susceptible to foliar-chewing herbivores. It is less known how
   other guilds of arthropods are affected by plant regrowth. We tested the
   hypotheses that clipping-induced resprouting and nutrient availability,
   separately and in combination, would (1) influence plant traits, (2)
   benefit chewing herbivores, sap-suckers, gaiters, and pre-dispersal seed
   predators, and (3) cascade up to the third trophic level by positively
   affecting herbivores. Resprouted plants were morphologically and
   phenologically different from undamaged plants; as a result, seed
   predation, infestation rate, richness, and diversity of seed predators
   increased, and species composition was altered. Leaf consumption by
   chewing herbivores was four times higher on resprouted plants. The
   number of galls decreased, whereas the abundance of sap-sucking and
   leaf-chewing insects was not affected. The incidence of predators and
   parasitoids was also higher on resprouted plants and on plants with
   nutrients added, but the increase was less pronounced compared to the
   herbivores they feed on. Thus, the effects of resprouting, contingent on
   nutrient availability, can propagate simultaneously through two
   independent tri-trophic level pathways.}},

Abstract = {{A common effect size metric used to quantify the outcome of experiments

   Here, I derive new variances and covariances for RR for several

   when means are based on repeated measures; and when the study has a
   correlated factorial design, or is multivariate. These developments are

Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Plants can resist herbivory through mechanisms of resistance (traits
   that reduce the amount of tissue lost to herbivores) and tolerance
   (traits that reduce the negative effects of herbivory on plant fitness).
   The expression of such traits requires the allocation of plant
   resources, and consequently, trade-offs between tolerance and resistance
   can occur in plants. For marine algae, little is currently known about
   the expression of tolerance, the relationship between tolerance and
   resistance, and the impact of resource availability on these traits.
   2. We manipulated herbivory (simulated or real) and nutrient
   availability in a series of laboratory and field experiments to test for
   tolerance to different types of damage under varying resource conditions
   in the brown alga Sargassum cf. podacanthoides. In addition to growth
   and photosynthetic responses of the alga, we measured the concentration
   of phlorotannins (secondary metabolites associated with resistance in
   many brown algae) to test for possible phenotypic trade-offs between
   traits of tolerance and resistance. Furthermore, we assessed whether the
   limiting resource model (LRM) could predict algal tolerance under
   different resource conditions.
   3. Sargassum cf. podacanthoides expressed traits of tolerance (increased
   growth rates and reallocation of resources) that were specific to both
   the type and severity of herbivory encountered. Consistent with the
   predictions of the LRM, nitrogen enrichment did not alter the
   compensatory growth responses of the alga. Correlations between growth
   and phlorotannin content were variable, dependent on the measure of
   growth analysed, and only weakly influenced by nutrient availability.
   Nutrient enrichment, however, consistently changed within-alga patterns
   of tissue composition and photosynthetic activity.
   4. Synthesis. Herbivory in the marine environment is often severe, and,
   similar to higher plants, tolerance to herbivory may be an important
   mechanism that maintains the productivity of marine algae. We
   demonstrate the potential applicability of the terrestrially derived LRM
   to predict algal tolerance under eutrophic conditions. Nutrient-induced
   changes to within-alga patterns of tissue composition should also be
   considered when evaluating the effects of nutrient enrichment on marine
   communities. Furthermore, as in higher plants, the relationships between
   traits of tolerance and resistance are variable in algae, and trade-offs
   cannot be assumed.}},

Abstract = {{A positive effect of herbivory on plant reproduction (overcompensation)
   has been documented mostly in monocarpic plants. Iteroparous perennials
   can be used to test whether enhanced reproduction in 1 year has negative
   future consequences as predicted by optimal allocation models. This
   study was intended to verify this prediction in the iteroparous herb
   Sedum maximum, applying mechanically simulated herbivory. I monitored
   132 labelled S. maximum individuals during 2 years of study. They were
   randomly assigned to two groups: clipped and control. Infructescence dry
   mass, total seed dry mass, seed size, germination rate and an increase
   of root dry mass during the season were assessed in the experimental
   plants. Since only roots can survive to the next season, root dry mass
   was considered a reliable measure of allocation to future performance.
   Clipped plants showed increased fruit and seed dry mass versus the
   controls, with no other aspect of reproduction affected. Apical bud
   removal also had a positive effect on increase of root dry mass. The
   results indicate true overcompensation in response to simulated
   herbivory with no future costs of increased reproduction. Moreover,
   increased plant reproduction as a result of herbivory is likely to
   persist in the following years: clipping increased not only seed
   production but also root growth. This response is inconsistent with the
   results of optimal allocation models and the discrepancy is probably due
   to violation of the resource limitation assumption. Plants adapted to
   tolerate herbivory seem not to reproduce at the maximum rate when
   undamaged, but rather withhold resources to be allocated to reproduction
   after herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is commonly considered as a trait associated with
   invasiveness in alien plants because it may enhance the ability of
   plants to occupy a wide range of environments. Although the evidence of
   greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is
   not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether
   invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their
   native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific
   comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken
   into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus,
   tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies
   reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory
   and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall,
   phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or
   non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when
   separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients,
   light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their
   native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying
   functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of
   a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their
   capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to
   their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic
   plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the
   initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for
   plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as
   invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after
   selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification
   of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile
   task because different traits favor invasiveness in different
   environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of
   specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global
   macro-analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of dormant meristems following apical damage is an
   important mechanism for tolerance of herbivore damage, but its impact
   could vary with resource availability. Here, we examined central
   predictions of the limiting resource model (LRM), according to which
   high resource availability can support damage tolerance in plants with
   deterministic apical dominance, but will have limited or no effect in
   plants that are induced to increase branching by increased resource
   availability regardless of damage. We examined these predictions by
   studying the branching patterns of Medicago truncatula plants in
   response to both light and water availabilities and their effects on
   tolerance of apical damage. We used plants from environments that were
   predicted to select for different levels of apical dominance. Intact
   plants from the more productive and competitive population exhibited
   strong apical dominance and refrained from branching even under full
   light, whereas plants from the less productive and sparser population
   exhibited greater plasticity in apical dominance and readily branched
   under high water and light. In accordance with the LRM, these
   differences translated into differential responsiveness to apical
   damage: given abundant water, apical damage induced the activation of
   lateral meristems and increased pod and seed production in plants from
   the more productive environment, but not in plants from the less
   productive environment. These results suggest an adaptive association
   between deterministic inhibition of lateral meristems and compensatory
   ability, which supports the hypothesis that greater compensatory
   responsiveness to apical damage could be a derivative of adaptation to
   other environmental stresses, such as light competition.}},

Abstract = {{After intense debate it is now accepted that nutrients (a bottom-up
   process) and herbivores (a top-down process) are both important controls
   of plant productivity in many systems. Besides their direct effects,
   herbivores may also have profound positive or negative indirect effects
   that can be modulated by nutrients and time. The interactive
   relationships between time, nutrient availability and herbivore impacts
   (direct and indirect) on plant growth dynamics are an emerging research
   topic that merits further effort. Here we did several experiments in a
   SW Atlantic marsh to contribute towards that gap by focusing on the
   dominant plant, Spartina densiflora, and one of the dominant herbivores,
   the crab Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata, in the marsh. Herbivory by
   the crab was highly seasonal, with most of the consumption occurring in
   fall. Even though crabs preferred nutrient enriched leaves, nitrogen
   content was not the driver of these seasonal variations. Crab herbivory
   had markedly indirect negative impacts on S. densiflora leaves, reducing
   their growth rates and increasing their senescence. These deleterious
   impacts may partially explain the seasonal decline in leaf growth and a
   net loss in leaf biomass observed in the fall. Fertilization did not
   seem to alter these processes. Adding nutrients increased leaf growth in
   the spring, where ambient herbivory was low, but it also increased
   herbivory in the fall, resulting in similar patterns as the ones
   observed under non-fertilized conditions. Herbivory by the crab also
   greatly affected the dynamics of S. densiflora stems. Increases in stem
   density in relation to initial conditions were larger in non-grazed than
   in grazed plots regardless of whether nutrients were added or not.
   Together, these results indicate that, in Southwestern marshes populated
   by S. densiflora and N. granulata, herbivory by the crab represents an
   important direct and indirect control of plant growth. Our results also
   emphasize the importance of considering impacts on growth rates and not
   only on biomass because not considering reduced growth after herbivory
   may lead to improper calculations of nutrient cycling or detritus
   production. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Resistance (R) genes have a proven record for protecting plants against
   biotic stress. A problem is parasite adaptation via Avirulence (Avr)
   mutations, which allows the parasite to colonize the R gene plant.
   Scientists hope to make R genes more durable by stacking them in a
   single cultivar. However, stacking assumes that R gene-mediated
   resistance has no fitness cost for the plant. We tested this assumption
   for wheat's resistance to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say)
   (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Our study included ten plant fitness measures
   and four wheat genotypes, one susceptible, and three expressing either
   the H6, H9, or H13 resistance gene. Because R gene-mediated resistance
   has two components, we measured two types of costs: the cost of the
   constitutively-expressed H gene, which functions in plant surveillance,
   and the cost of the downstream induced responses, which were triggered
   by Hessian fly larvae rather than a chemical elicitor. For the
   constitutively expressed H gene, some measures indicated costs, but a
   greater number of measures indicated benefits of simply expressing the H
   gene. For the induced resistance, instead of costs, resistant plants
   showed benefits of being attacked. Resistant plants were more likely to
   survive attack than susceptible plants, and surviving resistant plants
   produced higher yield and quality. We discuss why resistance to the
   Hessian fly has little or no cost and propose that tolerance is
   important, with compensatory growth occurring after H gene-mediated
   resistance kills the larva. We end with a caution: Given that plants
   were given good growing conditions, fitness costs may be found under
   conditions of greater biotic or abiotic stress.}},

Abstract = {{The mute swan (Cygnus olor Gmelin) is one of the largest herbivorous
   waterbirds in the world. Its population increased dramatically over the
   last decades in Western Europe, leading to concerns about its potential
   impact on aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, swan consequences on fishponds
   remain poorly investigated, although fishpond animal communities and
   economic value both largely depend on aquatic macrophytes. We carried
   out an experiment in the Dombes region (Eastern France) with 96
   exclosures on 24 fishponds. Our aim was to assess the impact of swan
   grazing on aquatic macrophyte presence, abundance and community
   structure (diversity and evenness) during the growing season (April to
   July). We also considered the potential effect of swan stay (i.e. number
   of swan days ha(-1)) and nutrient availability on macrophyte depletion.
   Swan grazing negatively affected the presence and abundance (\% cover)
   of macrophyte beds, particularly at high swan density. No significant
   effect on dry biomass was found. Furthermore, swan grazing negatively
   affected community structure, suggesting that mute swan promoted the
   dominance of a few species in macrophyte communities. Whatever the
   macrophyte variable considered, nutrient availability in fishponds did
   not affect macrophyte depletion rate. It is speculated that both the
   repeated use of the same fishponds by birds and their expansion within
   the landscape may lead to more acute and broader consequences for
   macrophyte beds over the longer term. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Plants rely on phenotypic plasticity to maintain performance and survive
   in changing environments. Stress such as herbivory has the potential to
   cause short-and long-term changes to a plant's phenotype. In response to
   simulated herbivory by clipping, plants either may show lower growth and
   fecundity or may overcompensate and exceed the size and fecundity of
   undamaged individuals. This study examined the short-and long-term
   responses to the timing and frequency of clipping in Barbarea vulgaris.
   In the greenhouse, clipping resulted in elevated growth rates, and
   individuals eventually matched the size of undamaged individuals. In the
   field, clipping had negligible effects on size or fitness components.
   Aboveground clipping also reduced the belowground biomass. One possible
   explanation for the size convergence and equal fecundity despite
   clipping 50\% of the leaves is that the belowground biomass supports the
   regrowth of the aboveground biomass. Stored belowground resources
   allowed plants to regenerate lost photosynthetic tissue. These results
   illustrate the ability of B. vulgaris to tolerate clipping. Regardless
   of the timing or frequency of clipping, plants that experienced biomass
   removal displayed remarkable plasticity and were able to maintain
   performance relative to undamaged plants.}},

Abstract = {{Plants can respond to herbivore damage by mounting a resistance response
   or by compensating for lost fitness. Both plant nutrition and
   interactions with soil microbes can affect these responses. It has been
   shown that resistance responses can occur before plants have been
   attacked by herbivores. Here we show that a tolerance type of response
   can occur when plants are exposed to, but not fed on by, herbivores.
   Alnus viridis (Chaix) DC. spp. crispa (Ait.) Turrill were grown in
   sealed containers under positive air pressure with either 0.5 mmol.L(-1)
   or 2.0 mmol.L(-1) nitrate and either inoculated or not inoculated with
   Frankia, their nitrogen-fixing symbiont. Plants were then exposed to the
   genus-specific aphid Prociphilus tessallatus Fitch, which failed to
   establish feeding colonies. Exposure to aphids, formation of
   nitrogen-fixing nodules, and elevated soil nitrogen levels all
   significantly increased plant yield with no interaction among these
   factors. A combination of high soil nitrogen, nodulation, and exposure
   to aphids resulted in the lowest plant root:shoot ratio. Plants that
   were grown with low nitrogen and were exposed to aphids showed increased
   nitrogen-fixing activity within a day of being exposed. These results
   provide further evidence to support the observation that plants can
   respond to cues from other organisms prior to receiving herbivore
   damage.}},

   grazing promoted patchiness, and among-transect variation in species
   diversity and grazing intensity were positively correlated. At a fine

Abstract = {{At the scale of the local plant community, we know very little about how
   spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity affects the diversity
   in types and levels of plant defenses. If environmental heterogeneity is
   an important mechanism influencing plant defense traits, then defense
   expression should co-vary spatially with environmental conditions and
   change as succession progresses. In this study, we examined how spatial
   heterogeneity and succession influence putative resistance and tolerance
   trait levels in late goldenrod Solidago altissima. We quantified the
   spatial distributions of herbivore damage and traits associated with
   resistance (leaf toughness, phenolics), tolerance (specific leaf area,
   relative growth rate, leaf addition rate and leaf senescence rate), and
   fitness (height, diameter, inflorescence biomass) of goldenrods within
   replicate early- and late-successional fields. Also, we characterized
   the local neighborhood (stem density, canopy cover, ground vegetative
   cover) and edaphic conditions (soil moisture, pH, N) surrounding each
   target ramet, and determined relationships between these environmental
   variables and goldenrod trait levels. The distribution of traits within
   fields was strongly non-random, and defense-trait levels were more
   strongly spatially structured (i.e. autocorrelated) in late- than in
   early-successional fields. Also, defense traits were most strongly
   correlated with aspects of the local plant neighborhood, and these
   relationships differed in important ways between successional stages. In
   late-successional fields, tolerance trait specific leaf area was
   positively correlated with canopy cover and negatively correlated with
   stem density. In early-successional fields, the relationship between
   ground vegetative cover and resistance (i.e. 1 - damage) was
   significantly stronger than in late-successional fields. A novel insight
   from this study is the possibility that changes in the biotic
   environment during succession may shift the expression of defense from a
   resistance to a tolerance strategy in our system. This study highlights
   the context dependence of plant defense trait levels, which may promote
   their spatial and temporal variability in heterogeneous landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{As herbivory usually leads to loss of photosynthesizing biomass, its
   consequences for plants are often negative. However, in favorable
   conditions, effects of herbivory on plants may be neutral or even
   beneficial. According to the compensatory continuum hypothesis plants
   can tolerate herbivory best in resource-rich conditions. Besides
   herbivory, also primarily positive biotic interactions like mycorrhizal
   symbiosis, bear carbon costs. Tritrophic plant-fungus-herbivore
   interaction further complicates plant's cost-benefit balance, because
   herbivory of the host plant is expected to cause decline in mycorrhizal
   colonization under high availability of soil nutrients when benefits of
   symbiosis decline in relation to costs. To gain insight into above
   interactions we tested the effects of plant size and resource
   manipulation (simulated herbivory and fertilization) on both
   above-ground performance and on root fungal colonization of the biennial
   Gentianella campestris.
   Clipping caused allocation shift from height growth to branches in all
   groups except in large and fertilized plants. For large plants nutrient
   addition may have come too late, as the number of meristems was most
   likely determined already before the fertilization. Clipping decreased
   the amount of DSE (dark septate endophytic) fungi which generally are
   not considered to be mycorrhizal. The effect of clipping on total fungal
   colonization and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal
   coils were found to depend on host size and resource level. Dissimilar
   mycorrhizal response to simulated herbivory in small vs. large plants
   could be due to more intensive light competition in case of small
   plants. Carbon limited small plants may not be able to maintain high
   mycorrhizal colonization, whereas large clipped plants allocate extra
   resources to roots and mycorrhizal fungi at the expense of above-ground
   parts. Our results suggest that herbivory may increase carbon limitation
   that leads re-growing shoots and fungal symbionts to function as
   competing sinks for the limited carbon reserves. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{A mechanistic understanding of the highly variable effects of herbivores
   on plant production in different ecosystems remains a major challenge.
   To explain these patterns, the compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH)
   predicts plants to compensate for defoliation when resources are
   abundant, whereas the growth rate hypothesis (GRH) makes the opposite
   claim of high herbivory tolerance under resource-poor conditions. The
   limiting resource model (LRM) tries to reconcile this dichotomy by
   incorporating the indirect effects of herbivores on plant resources and
   predicts that the potential for plant compensation is dependent upon
   whether, and how, herbivory influences limiting resources. Although
   extensively evaluated in laboratory monocultures, it remains uncertain
   whether these models can also explain the response of heterogeneous and
   multi-species natural plant communities to defoliation. Here we
   investigate community-wide plant response to defoliation and report data
   from a field experiment in the arid and primarily water-limited
   Trans-Himalayan grazing ecosystem in northern India involving clipping,
   irrigation and nutrient-feedback with herbivore dung. Without
   nutrient-feedback, plants compensated for defoliation in absence of
   irrigation but failed to compensate under irrigation. Whereas, in the
   presence of nutrient-feedback plants compensated for defoliation when
   irrigated. This divergent pattern is not consistent with the CCH and
   GRH, and is only partially explained by the LRM. Instead, these
   pluralistic results are consistent with the hypothesis that herbivory
   may alter the relative strengths of water and nutrient limitation since
   irrigation increased root:shoot ratio in absence of fertilization in
   unclipped plots, but not in the corresponding clipped plots. So,
   herbivory appears to increase relative strength of nutrient-limitation
   for plants that otherwise seem to be primarily water-limited. Extending
   the LRM framework to include herbivore-mediated transitions between
   water and nutrient-limitation may clarify the underlying mechanisms that
   modulate herbivory-tolerance under different environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{P>Resource availability is known to affect herbivore selectivity and the
   ability of plants to respond to herbivores. However, little information
   is available for the performance of invasive plants subject to insect
   herbivory and limited resources availability. We conducted a glasshouse
   experiment using both the invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides and its
   native congener Alternanthera sessilis, to compare the effects of
   resource availability on plant tolerance to herbivory. The results
   suggest that water availability affects plant tolerance to herbivory,
   such that stressful water conditions promoted greater herbivore
   tolerance for A. philoxeroides and decreased herbivore tolerance for A.
   sessilis. The addition of fertiliser also affected the plant's ability
   to respond to herbivory. Fertilised plants of both species generated
   more biomass and had greater tolerance to herbivory than unfertilised
   plants. Adding fertiliser appeared to increase the compensation capacity
   to herbivory for A. philoxeroides. In unfertilised conditions, moisture
   had no effect on A. philoxeroides tolerance to herbivory, and plants
   performed better under drought conditions. The results of this study may
   help to further our understanding of why biological control efforts
   against A. philoxeroides have been successful in some aquatic
   environments, but not others. Our study suggests that control of A.
   philoxeroides in high-moisture and nutrient poor environments should be
   more effective than control under nutrient rich and low-moisture soils.

Abstract = {{Restoration of grasslands dominated by tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix

   winter, combined with cessation of fertilization, as a restoration tool
   for modifying the competitive dynamics among herbaceous plants to
   restore tallgrass prairie communities in southeastern Kansas. In
   2004-2005, we compared responses of grassland plants and birds across a
   chronosequence of pastures that were winter-grazed from 1 yr to 5 yr. We
   compared winter-grazed pastures to pastures grazed year-round and to
   local native prairie remnants as starting and endpoints for restoration,
   respectively. Abundance of native warm-season grasses increased from 2\%
   to 3\% mean relative frequency in pastures grazed year-round to 18\% to
   30\% in winter-grazed pastures, and increased with duration of
   winter-grazing. Native warm-season grasses accounted for 1-6\% of total
   live aboveground biomass in pastures grazed year-round, 1-34\% in
   winter-grazed pastures, and 31-34\% in native prairie remnants. Tall
   fescue abundance and biomass were similar among grazing treatments, with
   a trend for tall fescue to be less dominant in winter-grazed pastures.
   Tall fescue made up 9-40\% of total aboveground biomass in year-round
   grazed pastures and 10-25\% in winter-grazed pastures. Grassland birds
   showed variable responses to winter-grazing. Dickcissels (Spiza
   americana) and Henslow's sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii) were more
   abundant in winter-grazed pastures, whereas eastern meadowlarks
   (Sturnella magna) and grasshopper sparrows (A. sauannarum) had similar
   abundance in pastures grazed year-round and during winter.
   Winter-grazing of pastures dominated by tall fescue combined with
   suspension of nitrogen fertilization could be an effective restoration
   technique that allows use of prairie rangeland while improving habitat

   For clonal reproduction, the octoploids had a higher tolerance than the

Abstract = {{Background: When infected with seed-transmitted fungal endophytes, some
   grasses produce a larger quantity of seeds, although these seeds are
   smaller than normal. The principles of life-history theory suggest that
   this size reduction could evolve if the infection reduces predation
   pressure.
   Question: Does the endophyte protect grass seedlings against herbivory?
   Hypothesis: Herbivores consume more seedlings that develop from
   endophyte-free grass seeds than from endophyte-infected grass seeds.
   Organisms: Epichloe typhina is the seed-transmitted endophytic fungus,
   the weeping alkaligrass (Puccinellia distans) seedlings are the hosts,
   and the grove snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is the herbivore.
   Methods: Our experiment consisted of two 66-h food-choice tests. The
   tests were performed consecutively and on the same individual snails. We
   offered snails freshly harvested weeping alkaligrass seedlings with and
   without the endophyte.
   Results: Starved snails consumed approximately 20\% less biomass of
   infected seedlings than uninfected seedlings. When the same snails were
   tested again shortly after their first contact with the endophyte, they
   exhibited an approximately 40\% reduction in seedling consumption, and
   food discrimination became undetectable.
   Conclusions: Toxins produced by endophytic fungi reduce the
   vulnerability of grass seedlings to snail herbivory}},

Abstract = {{In a mosaic landscape in N-Belgium (W-Europe), consisting of forest,
   grassland, and wooded pasture on former agricultural land, we assessed
   nitrogen redistribution by free-ranging cattle (+/- 0.2 animal units
   ha-1 yr-1). We examined if the spatial redistribution of nitrogen among
   habitats by cattle could restore nutrient-poor conditions in preferred
   foraging habitats, and conversely whether such translocation could lead
   to extreme eutrophication in preferred resting habitats. We used
   nitrogen content of different diet classes, habitat use, foraging and
   defecation behavior, weight gain, and nitrogen losses in the actual
   situation to explore four different habitat proportion scenarios and two
   different foraging strategies to calculate a net nitrogen balance per
   habitat. An atmospheric deposition of 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 with varying
   interception factors according to the habitat types was included in an
   integrated nitrogen balance. All scenarios showed a net nitrogen
   transport from grassland and wooded pasture to forest habitat. We found
   that nitrogen redistribution strongly depends on habitat proportion.
   Nitrogen losses from preferred grassland habitat can be high, given its
   proportion is small. Depletion is only to be expected at excretion-free
   areas and probably is of minor importance to trigger the establishment
   of woody species. In general, nitrogen transported by cattle was much
   lower than input by atmospheric deposition, but grazing can compensate
   for high N inputs in excretion-free areas and maintain grassland types
   that support critical loads of 20-25 kg N ha-1 yr-1. In none of the
   scenarios, N transport by cattle resulted in the exceeding of critical
   nitrogen loads to vulnerable forest ground vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory and water shortage are key ecological factors affecting plant
   performance. While plant compensatory responses to herbivory include
   reallocation of biomass from below-ground to above-ground structures,
   plant responses to reduced soil moisture involve increased biomass
   allocation to roots and a reduction in the number and size of leaves. In
   a greenhouse study we evaluated the effects of experimental drought and
   leaf damage on biomass allocation in Convolvulus demissus
   (Convolvulaceae), a perennial herb distributed in central Chile, where
   it experiences summer drought typical of Mediterranean ecosystems and
   defoliation by leaf beetles and livestock. The number of leaves and
   internode length were unaffected by the experimental treatments. The
   rest of plant traits showed interaction of effects. We detected that
   drought counteracted some plant responses to damage. Thus, only in the
   control watering environment was it observed that damaged plants
   produced more stems, even after correcting for main stem length (index
   of architecture). In the cases of shoot : root ratio, relative shoot
   biomass and relative root biomass we found that the damage treatment
   counteracted plant responses to drought. Thus, while undamaged plants
   under water shortage showed a significant increase in root relative
   biomass and a significant reduction in both shoot : root ratio and
   relative shoot biomass, none of these responses to drought was observed
   in damaged plants. Total plant biomass increased in response to
   simulated herbivory, apparently due to greater shoot size, and in
   response to drought, presumably due to greater root size. However,
   damaged plants under experimental drought had the same total biomass as
   control plants. Overall, our results showed counteractive biomass
   allocation responses to drought and damage in C. demissus. Further
   research must address the fitness consequences under field conditions of
   the patterns found. This would be of particular importance because both
   current and expected climatic trends for central Chile indicate
   increased aridity.}},

Abstract = {{Plant tolerance to herbivory may depend on local environmental
   conditions. Models predict both increased and decreased tolerance with
   increasing resources. Transgenerational effects of herbivory may result
   in cross-generation tolerance. We evaluated within- and potential
   between-generation consequences of deer browsing in light-gap and
   understory habitats in the forest-edge herb, Campanulastrum americanum.
   Plants were assigned to deer-browsed, simulated-herbivory, and control
   (undamaged) treatments in the two light environments. In light gaps,
   plants were eaten earlier, more frequently, and had less vegetative
   recovery relative to uneaten plants than in the understory. As a result,
   browsed light-gap plants had a greater reduction in flowers and fruit
   than understory plants. This reduced tolerance was in part because deer
   browsing damaged plants in light gaps more than those in the understory.
   However, in the simulated herbivory treatment, where damage levels were
   similar between light habitats, plants growing in high-resource light
   gaps also had reduced tolerance of herbivory relative to those in the
   forest understory. C. americanum's reproductive phenology was delayed by
   reduced light and the loss of the apical meristem. As a result,
   deer-browsed plants in the light gap flowered slightly later than
   uneaten plants in the understory. C. americanum has a polymorphic life
   history and maternal flowering time influences the frequency of annual
   and biennial offspring. The later flowering of deer-browsed plants in
   light gaps will likely result in a reduced frequency of high-fitness
   annual offspring and an increase in lower fitness biennial offspring.
   Therefore, additional between-generation costs of herbivory are expected
   relative to those predicted by fruit number alone.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of generalisations concerning plant responses to herbivory
   are based on studies of natural or simulated defoliation. However,
   effects caused by insects feeding on plant sap are likely to differ from
   the effects of folivory. We assessed the general patterns and sources of
   variation in the effects of sap feeding on growth, photosynthesis, and
   reproduction of woody plants through a meta-analysis of 272 effect sizes
   calculated from 52 papers. Sap-feeders significantly reduced growth
   (-29\%), reproduction (-17\%), and photosynthesis (-27\%); seedlings
   suffered more than saplings and mature trees. Deciduous and evergreen
   woody plants did not differ in their abilities to tolerate damage
   imposed by sap-feeders. Different plant parts, in particular below- and
   above-ground organs, responded similarly to damage, indicating that
   sap-feeders did not change the resource allocation in plants. The
   strongest effects were caused by mesophyll and phloem feeders, and the
   weakest by xylem feeders. Generalist sap-feeders reduced plant
   performance to a greater extent than did specialists. Methodology
   substantially influenced the outcomes of the primary studies;
   experiments conducted in greenhouses yielded stronger negative effects
   than field experiments; shorter (< 12 months) experiments showed bigger
   growth reduction in response to sap feeding than longer experiments;
   natural levels of herbivory caused weaker effects than infestation of
   experimental plants by sap-feeders. Studies conducted at higher
   temperatures yielded stronger detrimental effects of sap-feeders on
   their hosts. We conclude that sap-feeders impose a more severe overall
   negative impact on plant performance than do defoliators, mostly due to
   the lower abilities of woody plants to compensate for sap-feeders'
   damage in terms of both growth and photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Biocontrol agents of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), one of the
   most ubiquitous invasive aquatic species in the world, were introduced
   in the waterways of Florida, USA, more than 30 years ago but have not
   been as successful as expected. The high nutrient, high light, warm
   year-round temperatures and lack of natural predators provide an optimal
   growth environment for the plant. The current study was designed to test
   if a compensatory response by the water hyacinth plants to low levels of
   biomass removal was one of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of
   biocontrol agents in the successful control of water hyacinth. The
   plants were exposed to two levels of nutrient (high and low) and three
   levels (0\%, 10\% and 80\%) of simulated herbivory treatment. The effect
   of the nutrient and repeated (i.e., chronic) defoliation treatments was
   determined after 6 weeks. Plants with 10\% defoliation did not show any
   significant difference from control plants in biomass allocation or
   relative growth rate (RGR) in either nutrient concentration, while 80\%
   defoliation caused a significant decrease in the final RGR under high
   and low nutrient treatments. High nutrient treatment resulted in higher
   RGR and allocation to asexual reproduction resulting in higher biomass
   accumulation compared to the low nutrient treatment, which had higher
   root growth and allocation to sexual reproduction. Results from this
   study indicate that water hyacinth can fully compensate for low levels
   of continuous defoliation regardless of the nutrient concentration,
   which has implications and important considerations for biocontrol

   Hypotheses: There will be increased investment in axillary meristems and

   Organisms: Young Acacia gerrardii and A. raddiana trees.

   Methods: The treatments were: (I) a control (no removal of either the

   (3) removal of 75\% of the biomass of the plant including removal of the

   Protecting the apical meristem appeared to be important, although this

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{871-878}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Recent theory suggests that compensation or even overcompensation
   in stage-specific biomass can arise in response to increased mortality.
   Which stage that will show compensation depends on whether maturation or
   reproduction is the more limiting process in the population.
   Size-structured theory also provides a strong link between the type of
   regulation and the expected population dynamics as both depend on
   size/stage-specific competitive ability.
   2. We imposed a size-independent mortality on a consumer-resource system
   with Daphnia pulex feeding on Scenedesmus obtusiusculus to asses the
   compensatory responses in Daphnia populations. We also extended an
   existing stage-structured biomass model by including several juvenile
   stages to test whether this extension affected the qualitative results
   of the existing model.
   3. We found complete compensation in juvenile biomass and total
   population fecundity in response to harvesting. The compensation in
   fecundity was caused by both a higher proportion of fecund females and a
   larger clutch size under increased mortality. We did not detect any
   difference in resource levels between treatments.
   4. The model results showed that both stages of juveniles have to be
   superior to adults in terms of resource competition for the compensatory
   response to take place in juvenile biomass.
   5. The results are all in correspondence with that the regulating
   process within the population was reproduction. From this, we also
   conclude that juveniles were superior competitors to adults, which has
   implications for population dynamics and the kind of cohort cycles seen
   in Daphnia populations.
   6. The compensatory responses demonstrated in this experiment have major
   implications for community dynamics and are potentially present in any
   organisms with food-dependent growth or development.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{745-753}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{P>1. aged and natural ecosystems, herbivory can have a major impact on
   plant growth. Defoliation and shoot removal reduce the photosynthetic
   capacity of plants and are also thought to reduce allocation of carbon
   to roots and mycorrhizal fungi. However, evidence supporting this
   assumption remains equivocal.
   2. ducted a meta-analysis of 99 experiments, from 33 publications,
   measuring arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal colonization of roots after
   real or simulated herbivory removed leaves or shoots. We also explored
   how effects were moderated by the type of mycorrhiza, fertilization,
   experimental setting (laboratory or field), treatment (real herbivory of
   shoots, real herbivory of leaves, simulated herbivory of shoots,
   simulated herbivory of leaves), type of host plant, duration of the
   experiment and year of publication.
   3. Overall, herbivory reduced mycorrhizal colonization by about 3
   percentage points. Treatment, host plant type and year of publication
   were the only significant moderators, with real or simulated herbivory
   of leaves and real herbivory of shoots suppressing colonization, while
   simulated removal of shoots tended to increase colonization. Herbivory
   reduced colonization of perennial grasses and deciduous trees by about 4
   and 8 percentage points, respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization of
   annual crops was reduced by about 12 percentage points, although this
   was not significantly different from zero. Mycorrhizal colonization of
   perennial forbs and evergreen trees was also unaffected by herbivory,
   and colonization of mixtures of perennial grasses and forbs increased by
   about 15 percentage points following herbivory. Effect size increased
   with year of publication, likely due to shifts in experimental designs
   towards systems more likely to show positive effects of herbivory on
   mycorrhiza.
   4. Synthesis. Our results challenge the carbon-limitation hypothesis and
   suggest that herbivory, real or simulated, reduces mycorrhizal
   colonization by biologically meaningful amounts only in a limited subset

Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Insect herbivory can strongly affect ecosystem processes, and its
   relationship with plant diversity is a central topic in
   biodiversity-functioning research. However, very little is known about
   this relationship from complex ecosystems dominated by long-lived
   individuals, such as forests, especially over gradients of high plant
   diversity.
   2. We analysed insect herbivory on saplings of 10 tree and shrub species
   across 27 forest stands differing in age and tree species richness in an
   extraordinarily diverse subtropical forest ecosystem in China. We tested
   whether plant species richness significantly influences folivory in
   these highly diverse forests or whether other factors play a more
   important role at such high levels of phytodiversity.
   3. Leaf damage was assessed on 58 297 leaves of 1284 saplings at the end
   of the rainy season in 2008, together with structural and abiotic stand
   characteristics.
   4. Species-specific mean damage of leaf area ranged from 3\% to 16\%.
   Herbivory increased with plant species richness even after accounting
   for potentially confounding effects of stand characteristics, of which
   stand age-related aspects most clearly covaried with herbivory.
   Intraspecific density dependence or other abiotic factors did not
   significantly influence overall herbivory across forest stands.
   5. Synthesis. The positive herbivory-plant diversity relationship
   indicates that effects related to hypotheses of resource concentration,
   according to which a reduction in damage by specialized herbivores might
   be expected as host plant concentration decreases with increasing plant
   diversity, do not seem to be major determinants for overall herbivory
   levels in our phytodiverse subtropical forest ecosystem. We discuss the
   potential role of host specificity of dominant herbivores, which are
   often expected to show a high degree of specialization in many
   (sub)tropical forests. In the forest system we studied, a much higher
   impact of polyphagous species than traditionally assumed might explain
   the observed patterns, as these species can profit from a broad dietary
   mix provided by high plant diversity. Further testing is needed to
   experimentally verify this assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Dense ungulate populations in forest accompanied by high grazing
   intensities have the potential to affect plant population dynamics, and
   such herbivory effects on populations are hypothesised to differ along
   environmental gradients. We investigated red deer grazing and resource
   interaction effects on the performance and dynamics of the functionally
   important boreal shrub Vaccinium myrtillus using integral projection
   models (IPMs). We sampled data from 900 V. myrtillus ramets in 30 plots
   in two consecutive years across the boreo-nemoral pine forest on the
   island Svanoy, western Norway. The plots spanned two environmental
   gradients: a red deer grazing intensity gradient (assessed by Cervus
   elaphus faecal pellets), and a relative resource gradient
   (DCA-ordination of species composition). The use of IPMs enabled
   projections of population growth rate (lambda) using continuous plant
   size instead of forcing stage division upon the demographic data. We
   used the environmental gradients as continuous variables to explain the
   dynamics of V. myrtillus populations and found that both increasing
   grazing intensity and resource levels negatively affected lambda of the
   V. myrtillus populations. Interestingly, these factors interacted: the
   negative effects of grazing were strongest in the resource-rich
   vegetation, and higher resource levels reduced lambda more strongly than
   at low resource levels when grazing intensities became higher.
   Populations with lambda > 1 were projected if the grazing intensity was
   less than or equal to the mean grazing intensity on the island, and
   indicated that V. myrtillus is relatively tolerant of grazing. Variance
   decomposing showed that the decrease of lambda along the grazing
   gradient, both at low and high resource levels, was largely caused by
   reductions in plant growth. The use of IPMs together with important
   environmental gradients offered novel possibilities to study the
   synthesised effect of different factors on plant population dynamics.
   Here, we show that the population response of an abundant boreal shrub
   to ungulate grazing depends on resource level.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple insects are commonly introduced as biological control agents to
   reduce the performance of invasive plants. Little is known about the
   species-specific contributions of co-existing agents, and about the
   effects of insect density on the control of invasive plants. Several
   agents are expected to strengthen the control. The effects of insect
   type, density, and soil type on seedling survival and growth of the
   invasive tree Melaleuca quinquenervia were investigated in Florida. The
   biological control agents are Oxyops vitiosa (weevil) and
   Boreioglycaspis melaleucae (psyllid). A three-way factorial shade-house
   experiment was conducted, manipulating weevil density (zero/low/high),
   psyllid density (zero/low/high), and soil type (organic/sandy). Only
   high densities of one or both insects combined consistently reduced
   plant survival or growth; low densities did not. Overall, psyllids had
   stronger effects than weevils and for some performance parameters, the
   effects of one insect depended not only on its density but also on the
   density of the other insect. Interaction effects between insects were
   sometimes positive (i.e. seedling survival was lowest when both insects
   were in high densities). In other cases, high densities of only one
   agent were enough to reduce plant growth. Plants perform better on
   organic soils than on sandy soils. Weevils were more effective in
   reducing biomass on organic soils, while psyllids were more effective in
   reducing survival on sandy soils. Seedlings compensated for damage by
   producing more leaves, with the highest standing leaf crop at
   intermediate insect densities. These results show that the effectiveness
   of biological control on M. quinquenervia seedlings varies with insect
   species and depends upon insect density and soil type. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tree seedlings in tropical rain forests are subject to both damage from
   natural enemies and intense interspecific competition. This leads to a
   trade-off in investment between defense and growth, and it is likely
   that tree species specialized to particular habitats tailor this balance
   to correspond with local resource availability. It has also been
   suggested that differential herbivore impacts among tree species may
   drive habitat segregation, favoring species adapted to particular
   resource conditions. In order to test these predictions, a reciprocal
   transplant experiment in Sabah, Malaysia, was established with seedlings
   of five species of Dipterocarpaceae. These were specialized to either
   alluvial (Hopea nervosa, Parashorea tomentella) or sandstone soils
   (Shorea multi:flora, H. beccariana), or were locally absent (S. fallax).
   A total of 3000 seedlings were planted in paired gap and understory
   plots in five sites on alluvial and sandstone soils. Half of all
   seedlings were fertilized. Seedling growth and mortality were recorded
   in regular samples over 3.5 years, and rates of insect herbivore damage
   were estimated from censuses of foliar tissue loss on marked mature
   leaves and available young leaves. Greater herbivory rates on mature
   leaves had no measurable effects on seedling growth but were associated
   with a significantly increased likelihood of mortality during the
   following year. In contrast, new-leaf herbivory rates correlated with
   neither growth nor mortality. There were no indications of differential
   impacts of herbivory among the five species, nor between experimental
   treatments. Herbivory was not shown to influence segregation of species
   between soil types, although it may contribute toward differential
   survival among light habitats. Natural rates of damage were
   substantially lower than have been shown to influence tree seedling
   growth and mortality in previous manipulative studies.}},

Abstract = {{Defoliation, often caused by herbivory is a common cause of biomass loss
   for plants that can affect current and future growth and reproduction.
   There are three models that predict contrasting compensatory growth
   responses of plants to herbivory, and resource availability: (1) Growth
   rate model. (2) Compensatory continuum hypothesis and (3) Limiting
   resource model. The predictions of these three models were tested on the
   tree Brosimum alicastrum and the liana Vitis tiliifolia. Seedlings were
   subjected to three levels of experimental defoliation (0\%, 50\%, and
   90\% leaf removal) along a light resource gradient (1\%, 9\% and 65\%,
   of full Sun). In both species. defoliation significantly increased leaf
   production rate and relative growth rate of leaf area, but, not. of
   biomass. Net assimilation rate was the strongest driver of biomass
   growth in both species, but leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were
   also important in B. alicastrum. Compensatory responses of leaf area
   growth in B. alicastrum were significant, greater in higher than lower
   light availability consistent with the compensatory continuum hypothesis
   predictions, but in contrast to the growth rate model predictions. The
   limiting resource model offered an explanation for all possible
   experimental outcomes by directly considering the effects of
   environmental differences in resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{Leaves of 26 grass, herb, shrub and tree species were collected from
   mesotrophic grasslands to assess natural variability in bulk. fatty acid
   and monosaccharide delta C-13 values under different grazing management
   (cattle- or deer-grazed) on three sample dates (May, July and October)
   such that interspecific and spatiotemporal variations in whole leaf
   tissues and compound-specific delta C-13 values could be determined The
   total mean leaf bulk delta C-13 value for plants was -28 9 parts per
   thousand with a range of values spanning 7 5 parts per thousand
   Significant interspecific variation between bulk leaf delta C-13 values
   was only determined in October (P = <0 001) when delta C-13 values of
   the leaf tissues from both sites was on average 1.5 parts per thousand
   depleted compared to during July and May. Samples from May were
   significantly different between fields (P = 0 03) indicating an effect
   from deer- or cattle-grazing in young leaves. The average individual
   monosaccharide delta C-13 value was 0 8 parts per thousand higher
   compared with whole leaf tissues Monosaccharides were the most abundant
   components of leaf biomass, ie arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and
   glucose, and therefore. fluctuations in their individual delta C-13
   values had a major influence on bulk delta C-13 values. An average
   depletion of ca 1 parts per thousand in the bulk delta C-13 values Of
   leaves from the deer-grazed field compared to the cattle-grazed field
   Could be explained by a general depletion of 1.1 parts per thousand in
   glucose delta C-13 values, as glucose constituted >50\% total leaf
   monosaccharides. In October, delta C-13 values of all monosaccharides
   varied between species, with significant variation in delta C-13 values
   of mannose and glucose in July, and mannose in May. This provided an
   explanation for the noted variability in the tissue bulk delta C-13
   values observed in October 1999 The fatty acids C-16 0, C-18 2 and C-18
   3 were highly abundant in all plant species Fatty acid delta C-13 values
   were lower than those of bulk leaf tissues, average values of -37 4
   parts per thousand (C-16 0), -37 0 parts per thousand (C-18 2) and -36 5
   parts per thousand (C-18 3) were determined There was significant
   interspecific variation in the delta C-13 values of all individual fatty
   acids during October and July, but Only for C-18 2 in May (P = <0 05)
   This indicated that seasonal trends observed in the delta C-13 values of
   individual fatty acids were inherited from the isotopic Composition of
   primary photosynthate However, although wide diversity in delta C-13
   values of grassland plants ascribed to grazing management, interspecific
   and spatiotemporal influences was revealed, significant trends (P = <0

Abstract = {{Tolerance to apical meristem damage (AMD) is a form of plant defense

   about the effects of inorganic soil nutrient levels on tolerance to AMD,

   resolve conflicts among the models, the `limiting resources model' (LRM)
   was developed. However, we believe that the LRM is actually comprised of
   several different models, which we describe. Our study marks the first
   comprehensive and simultaneous test of the entire LRM framework,
   treating it explicitly as separate models, which also evaluates the
   models' underlying assumptions. We studied tolerance to AMD in
   laboratory-reared natural Populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from three
   different regions of Europe, spanning a wide latitudinal gradient. We
   show that, in different Populations of this species, basic responses to
   nutrients and damage are best described by different models, which are
   based on different assumptions and make different predictions. This
   demonstrates the need for complexity in our explanations, and suggests
   that no one existing model can account for all relationships between
   tolerance to AMD and nutrients. Our results also demonstrate that fruit

Abstract = {{Human involvement in food webs has been profound, bringing about
   enormous and disproportionate losses of large apex predators on land and
   in water. The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of
   indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to
   plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and
   nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation
   of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down
   interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food
   webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing
   plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller
   mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and
   whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food
   webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become
   superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey,
   extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can
   reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become
   rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery
   and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web
   modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of
   webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and
   parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of
   the challenge of future research.}},

Abstract = {{Light availability and herbivory are 2 major factors affecting the

   and herbivory interact to shape the sapling performance of cohabitant
   tree species emerges as a key issue. The purpose of this work is to
   experimentally analyze the influence of light conditions on tree
   responses to browsing. We evaluated the responses to browsing (simulated
   by mechanical clipping of 50\% of current-year shoots) of saplings from
   2 deciduous (Acer opalus ssp. granatense and Quercus pyrenaica) and 2
   evergreen (Quercus ilex and Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii)
   late-successional tree species, measuring an array of morphological,

   saplings grown for 2 y under 3 experimental light environments emulating
   natural microhabitats: full (open microhabitats), 80\% (below pioneer
   shrub canopy), and 13\% (below tree canopy) sunlight. Clipping affected
   biomass distribution, growth, and sapling size, while only slight
   physiological and biochemical effects were detected. Species
   characteristics and the light environment in which saplings grow
   determine their capacity to recover biomass lost after herbivore damage.
   Black pine was found to be the least tolerant species to clipping,

   Light scarcity increased the nutritional quality of plants and
   negatively affected herbivory tolerance of 3 of the 4 species.}},

Abstract = {{P>Analyses of plant tolerance in response to different modes of
   herbivory are essential to an understanding of plant defense evolution,

   tolerance. However, variation in defenses also occurs for the presence
   or absence of discrete chemical structures; yet, the effects of
   intraspecific polymorphisms on tolerance to multiple herbivores have not
   been evaluated.
   Here, in a glasshouse experiment, we investigated the variation for
   tolerance to different types of herbivore damage, and direct allocation
   costs, in 10 genotypes of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), a wild
   relative of Arabidopsis, with contrasting foliar glucosinolate chemical
   structures (methionine-derived glucosinolates vs glucosinolates derived
   from branched-chain amino acids).
   We found significant genetic variation for tolerance to different types
   of herbivore. Structural variations in the glucosinolate profile did not
   influence tolerance to damage, but predicted plant fitness. Levels of
   constitutive and induced glucosinolates varied between genotypes with
   different structural profiles, but we did not detect any cost of
   tolerance explaining the genetic variation in tolerance among genotypes.
   Trade-offs between plant tolerance to multiple herbivores may not

Abstract = {{Mediterranean-type ecosystems are increasingly prone to drought stress.
   Herbivory might limit plant functional responses to water shortage. This
   may occur as a result of plant resource depletion or due to the fact
   that leaf damage and drought may elicit opposite phenotypic responses.
   We evaluated the impact of herbivory on plant fitness in the field, and
   the effects of leaf damage on phenotypic plasticity to reduced soil
   moisture in a greenhouse. The study species was Convolvulus demissus, a
   perennial herb endemic to central Chile, which has a Mediterranean-type
   climate. Controlled herbivory by chrysomelid beetles (natural
   herbivores) in the Held had a negative impact on plant fitness,
   estimated as number of fruits. Whereas reduced soil moisture alone did
   not affect seedling survival, damaged seedlings (simulated herbivory)
   had greater mortality when growing under water shortage. The hypothesis
   that herbivory would constrain phenotypic plasticity was supported by
   significant statistical interactions between leaf damage and soil
   moisture, followed by inspections of reaction norms. This was verified
   both overall (all phenotypic traits taken together, MANOVA) and in four
   of the six traits evaluated (ANOVAs). When plants were damaged, the
   reaction norms in response to low soil moisture of water use efficiency,
   root:shoot ratio and xylem water potential showed reduced slopes. While
   undamaged plants increased root biomass in response to low moisture, the
   opposite trend was found for damaged plants. The simultaneous occurrence
   of herbivory and drought events might curtail recruitment in plant
   populations of central Chile and other Mediterranean-type ecosystems due
   to the inability of damaged seedlings to show functional responses to
   low soil moisture. This finding is of ecological significance in view of
   current and projected trends of increased aridity in these ecosystems.

Abstract = {{Global environmental changes, such as rising atmospheric CO(2)
   concentrations, have a wide range of direct effects on plant physiology,
   growth, and fecundity. These environmental changes also can affect
   plants indirectly by altering interactions with other species.
   Therefore, the effects of global changes on a particular species may
   depend on the presence and abundance of other community members. We
   experimentally manipulated atmospheric CO(2) concentration and amounts
   of herbivore damage (natural insect folivory and clipping to simulate
   browsing) to examine: (1) how herbivores mediate the effects of elevated
   CO(2) (eCO(2)) on the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis thaliana; and
   (2) how predicted changes in CO(2) concentration affect plant resistance
   to herbivores, which influences the amount of damage plants receive, and
   plant tolerance of herbivory, or the fitness consequences of damage. We
   found no evidence that CO(2) altered resistance, but plants grown in
   eCO(2) were less tolerant of herbivory-clipping reduced aboveground
   biomass and fruit production by 13 and 22\%, respectively, when plants
   were reared under eCO(2), but plants fully compensated for clipping in
   ambient CO(2) (aCO(2)) environments. Costs of tolerance in the form of
   reduced fitness of undamaged plants were detected in eCO(2) but not
   aCO(2) environments. Increased costs could reduce selection on tolerance
   in eCO(2) environments, potentially resulting in even larger fitness
   effects of clipping in predicted future eCO(2) conditions. Thus,
   environmental perturbations can indirectly affect both the ecology and
   evolution of plant populations by altering both the intensity of species
   interactions as well as the fitness consequences of those interactions.}},

   2009.-Herbivores may negatively impact plants by reducing biomass and
   decreasing fecundity. Rare or endangered plants may be particularly
   vulnerable to herbivore damage. However. plants may compensate for
   herbivory by increased growth or reproductive Output. We investigated
   compensatory growth and reproductive effort in Liatris ohlingerae
   (S.F.Blake) B.L.Robe, a federally-listed herb narrowly endemic to
   pyrogenic Florida scrub on the Lake Wales Ridge, by conducting biweekly
   surveys of observed herbivory and an herbivore exclusion experiment. In
   the field surveys, we assessed the effects of vertebrate herbivory
   ({''}topping{''}) and invertebrate leaf herbivory on plant size and
   fecundity and compared observed levels of herbivory across sites with
   different disturbance histories (scrub vs. roadside; scrub sites with
   differing time-since-fire). In the herbivore exclusion experiment, we
   compared the effects on plant size and fecundity of excluding vertebrate
   herbivores (toppers) only vs. excluding both vertebrate and invertebrate
   herbivores. We found that 62\% of plants in the Survey had one or more
   topped steins and that topping occurred more frequently in recently
   burned sites (< 8 years since fire vs. > 14 years since fire) and in
   scrub than in roadside sites. Topped plants were significantly shorter
   and had a greater number of steins (untopped plants only produced I
   stem). Topped plants were less likely to flower, began flowering later
   in the growing season, and produced fewer inflorescences,
   infructescences, achenes, and full achenes than untopped plants.
   Fifty-two percent of surveyed L. ohlingerae plants also showed evidence
   of invertebrate leaf herbivory with a mean of 24\% of leaves damaged.
   Plants damaged by invertebrate herbivores did not differ significantly
   in growth or reproduction compared with undamaged plants. In the
   experiment, exclusion of vertebrate herbivores resulted in taller
   plants, fewer stems, higher flowering frequency, earlier first
   flowering, and greater production of inflorescences, infructescences,
   achenes, and full achenes per plant; plants gained no additional
   benefits when invertebrates were excluded. Our study demonstrates that
   L. ohlingerae partially compensates for vertebrate herbivore damage at
   some sites, depending on the disturbance history. There are population
   level consequences of undercompensation; vertebrate topping resulted in
   a 30\% reduction in mean fecundity. Future research is necessary to
   determine if undercompensation jeopardizes the long-term persistence of
   L. ohlingerae populations.}},

Abstract = {{The modular construction of many plants and animals defies conventional
   approaches to the study of life histories and population dynamics. An
   important complication of modular construction is that individuals can
   rapidly decrease in size when some modules are removed or die or when an
   individual fragments. Most attempts to describe life histories and
   population dynamics of modular organisms classify individuals according
   to their size. This approach relies on the fundamental assumption that
   fragmentation and module loss have no consequences for an individual
   apart from a simple decrease in size. Here we experimentally test this
   assumption.
   Using a modular marine invertebrate, the encrusting bryozoan Watersipora
   subtorquata, as a model species, we manipulated colony size and then
   assessed performance against three potential explanatory models based on
   size, age, and damage. In a second experiment we disrupted the internal
   modular demography of colonies to determine whether the performance of a
   fragment is influenced by the type of modules that remain. Finally, we
   investigated how constraints on growth in modular organisms uniquely
   influence growth after module loss. We found that single-state variables
   such as size or age do not describe performance in our species. Internal
   constraints substantially reduce growth after a decrease in size, and
   the age of modules that remain determines the timing of reproductive
   onset and fecundity. A knowledge of the size history of individuals,
   including any decreases in size, is necessary to accurately describe
   life histories and population dynamics in this modular organism. Our
   results have major consequences for established methods for modeling the
   demography of modular organisms.}},

   Kuusamo (66 degrees 22'N; 29 degrees 18'E) and Oulu (65 degrees 02'N; 25
   degrees 47'E) in northern Finland.
   We conducted a fully factorial experiment with three factors: site (two
   levels), N fertilization (four levels) and disturbance (two levels). We
   measured treatment effects on understorey biomass, vegetation structure,
   and plant, soil and microbial N and C concentrations.
   The understorey biomass was not affected by fertilization either in the
   control or in the disturbance treatment. Fertilization reduced the
   biomass of deciduous Vaccinium myrtillus. Disturbance had a negative
   effect on the biomass of V. myrtillus and evergreen Vaccinium
   vitis-idaea and decreased the relative proportion of evergreen species.
   Fertilization and disturbance increased the biomass of grass Deschampsia
   flexuosa and the relative proportion of graminoids. The amount of
   NH(4)(+) increased in soil after fertilization, and microbial C
   decreased after disturbance.
   Our results suggest that the growth of slow-growing Vaccinium species
   and soil microbes in boreal forests are not limited by N availability.
   However, significant changes in the proportion of dwarf shrubs to
   graminoids and a decrease in the biomass of V. myrtillus demonstrate the
   susceptibility of understorey vegetation to N enrichment. N enrichment
   and disturbance seem to have similar effects on understorey vegetation.
   Consequently, increasing N does not affect the rate or the direction of
   recovery after disturbance. Moreover, our study demonstrates the
   importance of understorey vegetation as a C source for soil microbes in
   boreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{Resource availability may limit plant tolerance of herbivory. To predict
   the effect of differential resource availability on plant tolerance, the
   limiting resource model (LRM) considers which resource limits plant
   fitness and which resource is mostly affected by herbivore damage. We
   tested the effect of experimental drought on tolerance of leaf damage in
   Ipomoea purpurea, which is naturally exposed to both leaf damage and
   summer drought. To seek mechanistic explanations, we also measured
   several morphological, allocation and gas exchange traits. In this case,
   LRM predicts that tolerance would be the same in both water treatments.
   Plants were assigned to a combination of two water treatments (control
   and low water) and two damage treatments (50\% defoliation and
   undamaged). Plants showed tolerance of leaf damage, i.e., a similar
   number of fruits were produced by damaged and undamaged plants, only in
   control water. Whereas experimental drought affected all plant traits,
   leaf damage caused plants to show a greater leaf trichome density and
   reduced shoot biomass, but only in low water. It is suggested that the
   reduced fitness (number of fruits) of damaged plants in low water was
   mediated by the differential reduction of shoot biomass, because the
   number of fruits per shoot biomass was similar in damaged and undamaged
   plants. Alternative but less likely explanations include the opposing
   direction of functional responses to drought and defoliation, and
   resource costs of the damage-induced leaf trichome density. Our results
   somewhat challenge the LRM predictions, but further research including
   field experiments is needed to validate some of the preliminary
   conclusions drawn. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In biological control programs, the insect natural enemy's ability to
   suppress the plant invader may be affected by abiotic factors, such as
   resource availability, that can influence plant growth and reproduction.
   Understanding plant tolerance to herbivory under different environmental
   conditions will help to improve biocontrol efficacy. The invasive
   alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) has been successfully
   controlled by natural enemies in many aquatic habitats but not in
   terrestrial environments worldwide. This study examined the effects of
   different levels of simulated leaf herbivory on the growth of alligator
   weed at two levels of fertilization and three levels of soil moisture
   (aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats). Increasing levels of
   simulated (manual) defoliation generally caused decreases in total
   biomass in all habitats. However, the plant appeared to respond
   differently to high levels of herbivory in the three habitats.
   Terrestrial plants showed the highest below-above ground mass ratio
   (R/S), indicating the plant is more tolerant to herbivory in terrestrial
   habitats than in aquatic habitats. The unfertilized treatment exhibited
   greater tolerance than the fertilized treatment in the terrestrial
   habitat at the first stage of this experiment (day 15), but fertilizer
   appears not to have influenced tolerance at the middle and last stages
   of the experiment. No such difference was found in semi-aquatic and
   aquatic habitats. These findings suggest that plant tolerance is
   affected by habitats and soil nutrients and this relationship could
   influence the biological control outcome. Plant compensatory response to
   herbivory under different environmental conditions should, therefore, be
   carefully considered when planning to use biological control in
   management programs against invasive plants. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Browsing by ungulates has become a hotly debated issue in many European
   mountain forests in the past century. Acer pseudoplatanus L. and
   Fraxinus excelsior L. are broadleaved tree species that are
   preferentially browsed by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in central
   Europe. We analyzed growth data from shaded saplings of both tree
   species to quantify the extent to which height growth after game
   browsing is reduced in subsequent, unbrowsed years in forest stands.
   Sixty saplings of F. excelsior and A. pseudoplatanus from forest stands
   at Albisriederberg (Switzerland) were available to us that had been
   dissected into pieces that then were split in the middle for counting
   tree rings and assessing ungulate damage. We fitted the von Bertalanffy
   growth equation to these height growth data and included a reduction
   factor for winter browsing.
   Both tree species showed significantly reduced height growth in
   unbrowsed years after one to several browsing events in winter, and this
   effect increased with the number of browsing events. Saplings with a
   high growth rate showed a higher growth reduction. After winter
   browsing, height growth of A. pseudoplatanus saplings was less affected
   in unbrowsed years than that of F. excelsior saplings.
   We conclude that browsed saplings of these species in forest stands are
   not able to compensate browsing-induced height loss, but that height
   differences between browsed and unbrowsed saplings probably increase
   over time. A comparison between our analysis and the parameters
   estimated using equations published by Eiberle for predicting age at 130
   cm height suggests that our parameter values are rather conservative
   estimates of the growth reduction effect after winter browsing. Neither
   F. excelsior nor A. pseudoplatanus show a distinct pattern in
   browsing-induced growth reduction with respect to soil moisture,
   nutrient level, and altitude. We thus conclude that our results are
   likely to be valid for a wide range of forested sites.}},

Abstract = {{Practitioners of classical biological control of invasive weeds are
   confronted with a dual expectation: to achieve successful control of
   plant invaders and to avoid damage to nontarget plants and adverse
   indirect effects. In this paper we discuss key issues that we consider
   to be crucial for a safe, efficient, and successful classical biological
   control project, and that have also caused some recent controversy.
   These include selection of effective control agents, host specificity of
   the biological control agents, implications of the genetic population
   structure of the target populations, and potential impact on native food
   webs. With regard to improving the success rate of biological control of
   plant invaders, we first emphasize the importance of a clear a priori
   definition of success and a more ecosystem-based approach to better
   document both negative effects of the invasive plant as well as
   potential positive and negative effects of introducing biological
   control agents. Secondly, pre-release impact assessment could be
   improved by better focusing on how to reach high densities of the
   control agents and by including tolerance to and compensation of
   herbivory. Thirdly, we advocate a reinforced effort to integrate and
   combine biological control in combination with existing or potential
   management options. Finally, we propose various ecological and
   evolutionary hypotheses in the framework of our topic to document that
   biological control programmes against plant invaders also offer a great
   opportunity to gain new insights into basic processes in ecology and

Abstract = {{Human alterations to natural systems have resulted in a loss of
   biological diversity around the world. Amphibian population losses have
   been more severe than those of birds and mammals. Amphibian population
   declines are likely due to many factors including habitat loss, disease,
   contaminants, introduced species and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. The
   effect of UVB, however, varies widely among species and can vary within
   populations of the same species or at different life-history stages.
   This variation has often led to opposing conclusions about how UVB
   affects amphibians. We used meta-analysis techniques to explore the
   overall effects of UVB radiation on survival in amphibians. We also used
   recently developed factorial meta-analytic techniques to quantify
   potential interactions between UVB radiation and other stressors on
   amphibians. Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by
   1.9-fold compared with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible
   to damage from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were
   more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB
   radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental stressors
   and resulted in greater than additive effects on survival when 2
   stressors were present. Our results suggest that UVB radiation is an
   important stressor in amphibians, particularly in light of potential
   synergisms between UVB and other stressors in amphibian habitats.}},

Abstract = {{This study experimentally analyses the response to simulated herbivory
   of juvenile Scots pine of two different ages in contrasting abiotic
   scenarios, focusing on the potential dual role of browsing ungulates:
   negative, by removing aerial biomass, and positive, by stimulating
   compensation capacity and providing nutrients by depositing their
   excrement. Compensation against herbivory was investigated by
   experimentally clipping a set of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.
   nevadensis) juveniles, grown under different levels of light and
   nutrient availability. The responses analysed were survival,
   trunk-diameter growth, leader-shoot growth, increment in number of
   meristems, RGR, biomass of needles, shoots, root and whole plant, and
   root-to-shoot ratio. Clipping consistently resulted in a worse survival
   and performance of pines with respect to unclipped ones. From the
   factors analysed, light availability was responsible mainly for the
   variations in plant performance, while the addition of nutrients was
   much less important. Age was also important, with older pines showing in
   general better performance after clipping. Overall, clipping invariably
   had a negative effect on Scots pine, since none of the combinations of
   abiotic factors used resulted in overcompensation. However, the
   intensity on this negative effect proved quite variable, from almost an
   exact compensation in clipped older pines under full sunlight
   availability to very poor performance and high death probability in
   younger pines in shade. Scots pine cannot overcompensate after clipping,
   but, depending of the environmental conditions, the negative result of
   clipping varies from severe undercompensation to almost exact
   compensation. Also, small differences in sapling age can promote
   significant differences in sapling response to clipping and light

Abstract = {{Plant tolerance is the ability to reduce the negative impact of
   herbivory on plant fitness. Numerous studies have shown that plant
   tolerance is affected by nutrient availability, but the effect of soil
   moisture has received less attention. We evaluated tolerance of apical
   damage (clipping that mimicked insect damage) under two watering regimes
   (control watering and drought) in the tarweed Madia sativa (Asteraceae).
   We recorded number of heads with seeds and total number of heads as
   traits related to fitness. Net photosynthetic rate, water use
   efficiency, number of branches, shoot biomass, and the root:shoot
   biomass ratio were measured as traits potentially related to tolerance
   via compensatory responses to damage. In the drought treatment, damaged
   plants showed approximate to 43\% reduction in reproductive fitness
   components in comparison with undamaged plants. In contrast, there was
   no significant difference in reproductive fitness between undamaged and
   damaged plants in the control watering treatment. Shoot biomass was not
   affected by apical damage. The number of branches increased after damage
   in both water treatments but this increase was limited by drought
   stress. Net photosynthetic rate increased in damaged plants only in the
   control watering treatment. Water use efficiency increased with drought
   stress and, in plants regularly watered, also increased after damage.
   Root:shoot ratio was higher in the low water treatment and damaged
   plants tended to reduce root:shoot ratio only in this water treatment.
   It is concluded that water availability limits tolerance to apical
   damage in M. sativa, and that putative compensatory mechanisms are

Abstract = {{Nutrient availability and herbivory control the biomass of primary
   producer communities to varying degrees across ecosystems. Ecological
   theory, individual experiments in many different systems, and
   system-specific quantitative reviews have suggested that (i) bottom-up
   control is pervasive but top-down control is more influential in aquatic
   habitats relative to terrestrial systems and (ii) bottom-up and top-down
   forces are interdependent, with statistical interactions that synergize
   or dampen relative influences on producer biomass. We used simple
   dynamic models to review ecological mechanisms that generate independent
   vs. interactive responses of community-level biomass. We calibrated
   these mechanistic predictions with the metrics of factorial
   meta-analysis and tested their prevalence across freshwater, marine and
   terrestrial ecosystems with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 191
   factorial manipulations of herbivores and nutrients. Our analysis showed
   that producer community biomass increased with fertilization across all
   systems, although increases were greatest in freshwater habitats.
   Herbivore removal generally increased producer biomass in both
   freshwater and marine systems, but effects were inconsistent on land.
   With the exception of marine temperate rocky reef systems that showed
   positive synergism of nutrient enrichment and herbivore removal,
   experimental studies showed limited support for statistical interactions
   between nutrient and herbivory treatments on producer biomass. Top-down
   control of herbivores, compensatory behaviour of multiple herbivore
   guilds, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of interactions, and
   herbivore-mediated nutrient recycling may lower the probability of
   consistent interactive effects on producer biomass. Continuing studies
   should expand the temporal and spatial scales of experiments,
   particularly in understudied terrestrial systems; broaden factorial
   designs to manipulate independently multiple producer resources (e.g.
   nitrogen, phosphorus, light), multiple herbivore taxa or guilds (e.g.
   vertebrates and invertebrates) and multiple trophic levels; and - in
   addition to measuring producer biomass - assess the responses of species
   diversity, community composition and nutrient status.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory and resource interact to influence plant regrowth following

   a simulated grazing gradient (0\%, 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of shoot removal)
   at three water or nutrient levels to determine the interaction of
   resource and herbivory on Leymus chinensis, a perennial, dominant
   species in the eastern Eurasian steppes. Interactions between water
   availability and clipping intensity on the relative height growth rate
   (RHGR) and bud number were significant. Significant interactions between
   nutrient and clipping on RHGR, total biomass and specific leaf area
   (SLA) were also found. Total biomass and bud number, showing a unimodal
   curve along the clipping gradient in resource-rich environments, were
   highest at light clipping level, suggesting that this species has the
   plastic compensatory responses from under- to overcompensation.
   Interactions between herbivory and water or nutrient were opposite to
   each other. The ``cooperative{''} interactions between water and
   herbivory magnified the difference in grazing tolerance of L chinensis
   between high and low water treatments. The ``antagonistic{''}
   interactions between nutrient and herbivory, on the other hand, were
   reflected in the lower tolerance to heavy clipping in the high nutrient
   than low nutrient treatments. Results partly support the limiting
   resource model (LRM). A modified and simplified graphic model of the LRM
   was proposed based on our results. The new LRM clearly demonstrated that
   ``cooperative{''} interactions between varying water levels and clipping
   intensities aggravate the detrimental impacts of herbivores on plant
   growth and reproduction, whereas ``antagonistic{''} interactions between

   complicated view of the plasticity of resource uptake and allocation
   than the ones considered by the models tested. Fruit mass was negatively
   affected by herbivore damage only under elevated CO2, and only for
   certain harvest dates. Increased CO2 had no effect on the number of leaf

Abstract = {{Tolerance, or the capacity of a genotype to survive and reproduce

   proximate cause of this variation is resource availability, which can
   influence tolerance through mechanisms such as growth rate and
   photosynthesis. We examined the effect of high and low soil nutrient
   levels on the relationship between tolerance and two of its underlying
   mechanisms, biomass regrowth and photosynthetic upregulation, among
   genotypes of the Mediterranean annual grass Avena barbata. Although
   defoliated plants did not reach the same biomass as controls, biomass
   regrowth was higher at high nutrients. However, increased seed abortion
   at high nutrients caused tolerance to be the same in both nutrient
   treatments. Increased seed abortion also uncoupled biomass regrowth from
   tolerance at high nutrients. We found no evidence for photosynthetic
   upregulation in defoliated compared to control plants in either nutrient
   treatment. However, tolerance was positively correlated with
   predefoliation photosynthetic efficiency at high nutrients. Thus,
   constitutive photosynthetic efficiency may be a better predictor of

Abstract = {{The ability of saplings to tolerate browsing (i.e. the ability to
   persist with reduced biomass and to compensate for biomass loss) is
   influenced by the level of stress and their growth strategies.
   Ultimately, insight into species-specific responses of saplings to
   browsing, shade and competition from neighbours will help explain
   diversity, structure and function of grazed ecosystems such as the
   endangered wood-pasture systems. We measured the survival, whole-sapling
   biomass and compensatory growth responses of two coniferous (Picea abies
   and Abies alba) and two deciduous (Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus
   sylvatica) tree species to simulated summer browsing (one single
   clipping event), shade (installation of a shade cloth) and neighbour
   removal (mowing surrounding vegetation to ground level) treatments and
   the interactions between them after two-growing seasons. For all
   species, there were interacting effects on growth of browsing and
   environmental condition (shade and neighbours). Simulated browsing
   resulted in relatively smaller growth losses when plants were growing
   slowly due to competitive conditions related to herbaceous neighbours.
   Although none of the clipped saplings could fully compensate for their
   biomass losses, the saplings were closer to compensation under high
   competitive conditions than under low competitive conditions. Survival
   of the clipped saplings remained relatively high and was only
   significantly reduced for Picea and Acer. Picea was least tolerant of
   competition and was the only species for which growth was not negatively
   affected by strong irradiance of a mountain pasture. Surprisingly, the
   tolerance of saplings to herbivory as browsing tolerance was enhanced
   under conditions that negatively affected sapling performance (i.e.
   survival and growth). Apparently, the relative impact of browsing at the
   early sapling stage is linked to tree life history characteristics such
   as competition and shade tolerance and will be lower in situations with
   intense competitive interactions and/or strong irradiance.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivore damage can select for tolerance in plant populations where
   genetic variation for tolerance exists. The causes underlying variation
   in tolerance are not fully resolved. We assessed the importance of two
   potential mechanisms for tolerance by examining its relationship with
   leaf photosynthetic rate and relative biomass allocation across plant
   organs.
   We monitored responses of 12 aspen (Populus tremuloides) genotypes,
   grown in a common garden under two levels of nutrient availability, to
   defoliation in two successive seasons. Tolerance of each genotype was
   calculated as the difference in growth between defoliated and
   undefoliated trees grown under the same nutrient conditions.
   Although light-saturated leaf photosynthesis increased in response to
   nutrient addition and defoliation, it did not vary among genotypes and
   was not correlated with tolerance.
   Tolerance was, however, correlated with patterns of biomass allocation.
   Under low-nutrient conditions it was positively correlated with the
   proportion of biomass in stems just prior to defoliation, while under
   high-nutrient conditions it was correlated with greater allocation to
   stems in response to damage.
   Herbivores may select for specific patterns of biomass allocation in
   trees, and do so differently in different environments. The positive
   correlation between tolerance and relative allocation to stems, as
   opposed to roots, runs counter to reports from studies of herbaceous
   species and underscores the need for further exploration of mechanisms
   of tolerance in woody plants.}},

Abstract = {{.-The effect of shoot damage on plant performance depends partly on a
   plant's ability to recover by growth compensation. Plant populations in

   risks of damage and therefore might be expected to have evolved
   significant compensation ability. We investigated shoot damage and
   subsequent growth compensation in Iowa populations of the annuals Linum
   rigidum and L. sulcatum. To estimate damage rate and responses to damage
   under natural conditions, we collected two data sets. The first
   consisted of over 200 herbarium specimens collected over a 113-y period
   and the second consisted of field data for four populations in the same
   growing season. A companion experiment investigated damage responses
   under controlled greenhouse conditions and identified possible
   mechanisms of compensation. The study species frequently experience
   apical meristem removal in nature, Per-individual damage-rate estimates
   ranged from 33-54\% in L. rigidum and from 12-24\% in L. sulcatum. Both
   species compensate substantially in mature height, branch number and
   biomass under field conditions. Compensation in the greenhouse tended to
   be incomplete, perhaps because the greenhouse experiment may have failed
   to simulate natural conditions and ended before maximum sizes had been
   reached. The major mechanism of compensation appears to be rapid
   activation of axillary meristems, without contributions from altered

   to three functional groups: grasses, legumes and (non-leguminous) herbs.
   With the addition of nutrients aboveground biomass increased and species

Abstract = {{The presence of consumers not only alters the mean biomass of the prey
   assemblage, but also affects the spatial heterogeneity of biomass
   distribution. Whereas the mean prey biomass is generally reduced by
   consumer presence, the effect on spatial heterogeneity is less
   clear-cut. A meta-analysis of almost 600 field experiments manipulating
   the presence of benthic invertebrate or vertebrate grazers was conducted
   to analyze the effect of grazers on both the absolute spatial
   variability of periphyton biomass and the relative variability, which
   was standardized to the mean. Effects on absolute variability were
   measured as the log response ratio of the standard deviation of biomass
   (LR-SD), whereas effects on relative variability were measured as the
   log response ratio of the coefficient of variation of biomass (LR-CV).
   The overall magnitude and range of LR-SD and LR-CV indicated that
   grazers not only reduced periphyton biomass, but also substantially
   altered their spatial distribution. However, grazer effects differed
   strongly for absolute and relative variability. On average, grazers
   reduced the absolute spatial variability in prey biomass by 50\%
   (average LR-SD = -0.68) but increased the relative variability by 24\%
   (average LR-CV = 0.22). The magnitude of LR-SD strongly depended on the
   efficiency of grazing, with strong biomass removal leading to strong
   homogenization. Moreover, LR-CV and LR-SD were significantly affected by
   habitat type (freshwater vs. coastal) and substrata. Given the
   importance of spatial heterogeneity for resource uptake, competition and
   the maintenance of diversity, grazer presence has potentially strong
   indirect effects on the interactions within prey assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial defoliation is often used in studies of induced defense
   reactions of plants to damage by arthropods. However, little is known
   about the role of various external factors that may determine the nature
   of inducible defenses. Here we tested whether light level under which
   plants grow could affect the natural invasion of two-spotted spider mite
   (Tetranychus urticae Koch) with a broad range of host plants. For this
   study we used two host species that differ widely in shade tolerance:
   shade-adapted Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and sun-adapted
   European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.). The purpose of this study
   was to explore mite invasion and to test whether prior simulated
   defoliation, light conditions and host species differences in secondary
   defense metabolites (soluble phenolics) play a role in the pattern of
   invasion. One-year-old maple and ash seedlings growing in pots were
   placed into two shade houses that produced a treatment with 5\% light
   transmittance, and the second group of seedlings was placed in full
   sunlight. The experiment was carried out in a location chronically
   affected by spider mite presence. The defoliation was performed in
   mid-May by manual removal of 0 (control), 25, 50, 75 and 100\% of
   leaves. Natural two-spotted spider mite invasion took place in mid-July
   and was observed only on seedlings growing in the shade. Mites were
   found on leaves of almost all seedlings. However, the intensity of
   feeding damage to leaves was related to the level of earlier
   defoliation. Control and slightly to moderately (25-50\%) defoliated
   seedlings of both species were most affected by spider mites. Mite
   feeding behavior was directly linked to changes in concentration of leaf
   carbon and phenolic compounds. Carbon content was positively correlated
   with the percent of seedlings damaged by spider mites in both tree
   species (R(2)>0.80; P<0.05). The highest concentration of phenolic
   compounds was observed in leaves of seedlings subjected to 50 and 75\%
   defoliation. Our results indicated that two-spotted spider mites
   preferred plants grown in a shade environment and within these plants
   favored leaves which are high in carbon and low in phenolic compounds.
   Both plant species were able to survive early season leaf damage
   inflicted by spider mites. Inducible phenolic compounds were among
   defensive secondary metabolites contributing to low spider mite success
   in plants recovering from artificial spring defoliation.}},

Abstract = {{To understand how large herbivores interact with their food resources
   and the ecosystem, it is necessary to understand plant growth responses
   to biomass loss. Tolerance to biomass loss, and the ability to regrow
   new photosynthetic tissue after herbivore attack, is one such important
   mechanism. Here we experimentally studied how year-round browsing
   corresponding to four different levels of moose, Alces alces, population
   density affected total annual browse biomass production, which also
   serves as a proxy for production of new photosynthetic tissue, in birch
   (Betula pubescens and B. pendula) and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris,
   along a habitat productivity gradient. Our results revealed that habitat
   productivity index was the most important variable determining annual
   browse biomass production for birch, and that a high moose density and
   biomass removals of 25-40\% annually actually could stimulate birch
   above-ground productivity in more productive sites. Contrary to birch,
   pine was not affected by habitat productivity index, and appeared to
   have much lower regrowth capacity than birch. For pine, percent biomass
   removed was the most important factor affecting annual browse biomass
   production, which decreased with increasing levels of biomass removal.
   We also tested if birch and pine responded to biomass removal by
   allocating more resources to browse biomass production at in the lower
   portion of the stem (0-0.5 m), which was protected from biomass removal
   in winter. Birch did not allocate more resources to biomass production
   in the lower portion of the stem, whereas pines subjected to high
   biomass removal had more biomass in the lower portion of the stem than
   those protected from losses. Our study thus shows that plant responses
   can be linear or non-linear along the range of herbivore densities we
   studied, and that responses can change from negative to positive along
   underlying habitat productivity gradients.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. A prominent idea in the literature on plant-herbivore interactions is
   that fast-growing species have low resistance but high resilience to
   herbivory. In other words, fast-growing species are selectively eaten by
   herbivores but recover quickly following damage. Many studies have
   challenged the generality of this theory, but little attention has been
   paid to plant species that have evolved in the absence of major groups
   of herbivores. Here we analyse whether this resistance-resilience
   trade-off applies to New Zealand woody species, which evolved without
   exposure to mammalian herbivores until their introduction in 19th
   century.
   2. We simulated deer browse by clipping saplings of 12 tree species to
   varying extents (0, 20, 40, 80 and 100\% of leaf-bearing branches
   removed), and quantified the shoot growth, diameter growth and survival
   of these saplings. The time taken to regrow the removed branches was
   generally slow, but varied among species. For example, species took
   between 0.5 and 3 years to recover from removal of 60\% of branches. It
   was the inherently fast-growing species that recovered most quickly.
   Some species had stimulated shoot growth at moderate levels of clipping
   (40-60\%) but this effect had relatively little effect on recovery time
   compared with differences in potential growth rates of species.
   3. Diameter growth rate fell linearly with increased clipping intensity
   for all 12 species, and there was no indication of recovery 2 years
   after the treatment. We speculate that saplings invested in rebuilding
   their canopies following clipping, and that few resources were left over
   for diameter growth.
   4. Few saplings died as a result of clipping, except when 100\% of
   leaf-bearing shoots were removed, in which case five species died in
   substantial numbers (> 15\%), including all three conifers in the study.
   5. Previous work has shown that the most palatable species (i.e. those
   with low resistance) have leaves with low fibre content. We find that
   these species are relatively fast growing and recover most rapidly from
   simulated browsing (i.e. are highly resilient). This provides some
   support for a resistance-resilience trade-off related to potential
   growth rates.
   6. Deer invasion in New Zealand was associated with the loss of short
   soft-leaved tree species from the browse layer. Our study suggests that
   the most palatable species have the potential to grow fast and may be in
   a relatively strong position to recover if deer are eradicated.}},

Abstract = {{Abundant large herbivores can strongly alter vegetation composition,
   shifting the ecosystem into a lasting state of changed productivity.
   Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and
   arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to
   differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we
   devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway,
   possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world.
   The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were
   assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site
   fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation
   interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring
   management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two
   last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities
   more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the
   low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional
   groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on
   ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on
   plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling
   design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity
   (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found
   no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most
   consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were
   found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on
   ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators,
   large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the
   high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to
   fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have
   homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental
   productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation
   ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral
   effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem
   productivity in high-density districts.}},

Abstract = {{dAlthough it is widely acknowledged that a plant's tolerance of
   herbivore damage depends on resource availability in the plant's
   environment, there is no consensus on whether higher resource levels
   lead to greater or to lower tolerance. The prevailing model, the
   compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH), predicts that tolerance of
   herbivory should be greater in high-resource or low-competition
   conditions. The main rival hypothesis, the growth rate model (GRM),
   makes the opposite prediction: tolerance of herbivory should be greater
   in more stressful conditions. The tolerance predictions of a recently
   introduced model, the limiting resource model (LRM), are more flexible
   and depend on the type of resource and herbivore under consideration. We
   reviewed 48 studies ( from 40 published articles) of plant tolerance of
   leaf damage in conditions differing in levels of light, inorganic
   nutrients, water stress, or competition. The results of 31\%, 48\%, and
   95\% of the studies were consistent with the predictions of the CCH,
   GRM, and LRM, respectively. Thus, by considering which resource is
   primarily affected by herbivory and which resource is limiting a plant's
   fitness, the LRM offers a substantial advance in predicting how
   tolerance will be affected by environmental differences in resource
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Plants engage in multiple, simultaneous interactions with other species;
   some ( enemies) reduce and others (mutualists) enhance plant
   performance. Moreover, effects of different species may not be
   independent of one another; for example, enemies may compete, reducing
   their negative impact on a plant. The magnitudes of positive and
   negative effects, as well as the frequency of interactive effects and
   whether they tend to enhance or depress plant performance, have never
   been comprehensively assessed across the many published studies on plant
   - enemy and plant - mutualist interactions. We performed a meta-analysis
   of experiments in which two enemies, two mutualists, or an enemy and a
   mutualist were manipulated factorially. Specifically, we performed a
   factorial meta-analysis using the log response ratio. We found that the
   magnitude of ( negative) enemy effects was greater than that of (
   positive) mutualist effects in isolation, but in the presence of other
   species, the two effects were of comparable magnitude. Hence studies
   evaluating single-species effects of mutualists may underestimate the
   true effects found in natural settings, where multiple interactions are
   the norm and indirect effects are possible. Enemies did not on average
   influence the effects on plant performance of other enemies, nor did
   mutualists influence the effects of mutualists. However, these averages
   mask significant and large, but positive or negative, interactions in
   individual studies. In contrast, mutualists ameliorated the negative
   effects of enemies in a manner that benefited plants; this overall
   effect was driven by interactions between pathogens and belowground
   mutualists ( bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi). The high frequency of
   significant interactive effects suggests a widespread potential for
   diffuse rather than pairwise coevolutionary interactions between plants
   and their enemies and mutualists. Pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi
   enhanced plant performance more than did bacterial mutualists. In the
   greenhouse ( but not the field), pathogens reduced plant performance
   more than did herbivores, pathogens were more damaging to herbaceous
   than to woody plants, and herbivores were more damaging to crop than to
   non-crop plants ( suggesting evolutionary change in plants or herbivores
   following crop domestication). We discuss how observed differences in
   effect size might be confounded with methodological differences among
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Plants have multiple strategies to deal with herbivory, ranging from
   chemical or physical defenses to tolerating damage and allocating
   resources for regrowth. Grasses usually tolerate herbivory, but for some
   cool-season grasses, their strategy may depend upon their interactions
   with intracellular symbionts. Neotyphodium endophytes are common
   symbionts in pooid grasses, and, for some host species, they provide
   chemical defenses against both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores.
   Here, it was tested whether defenses provided by Neotyphodium
   coenophialum in Lolium arundinaceum (tall fescue) are inducible by both
   mechanical damage and herbivory from an invertebrate herbivore,
   Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), via a bioassay and by quantifying
   mRNA expression for lolC, a gene required for loline biosysnthesis.
   Both mechanical and herbivore damage had a negative effect on the
   reproduction of a subsequent herbivore, Rhopalosiphum padi (bird
   cherry-oat aphid), and herbivore damage caused an up-regulation of lolC.
   Uninfected grass hosts also had significantly higher foliar N\% and
   lower C : N ratio compared with infected hosts, suggesting greater
   allocation to growth rather than defense.
   For L. arundinaceum, N. coenophialum appears to switch its host's
   defensive strategy from tolerance via compensation to resistance.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{749-763}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope
   with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual
   phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained
   by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However,
   phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and
   plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to
   simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological
   factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value,
   but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have
   typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic
   responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of
   conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and
   that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence
   plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may
   limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely
   attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it
   is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait- mediated
   interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with
   other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be
   included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of
   plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to

   In November, we did not find significant differences in biochemistry of

Abstract = {{Eutrophication and predator additions and extinctions are occurring in
   ecosystems worldwide. Although theory predicts that both will strongly
   alter the distribution of biomass in whole communities, empirical
   evidence has not been consolidated to quantitatively determine whether
   these theoretical predictions are generally borne out in real
   ecosystems. Here we analyze data from two types of trophic cascade
   studies, predator removals in factorial combination with fertilization
   and observed productivity gradients, to assess the role of top-down and
   bottom-up forces in structuring multi-trophic communities and compare
   results from these analyses to those from an extensive database of
   trophic cascade studies. We find that herbivore biomass declines and
   plant biomass increases in the presence of predators, regardless of
   system productivity. In contrast, while plants are increased by
   fertilization, this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in
   either the presence or absence of predators. These patterns are
   consistent among marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems and are
   largely independent of study size and duration. Thus, top-down effects
   of predation are transferred through more trophic levels than are
   bottom-up effects of eutrophication, showing strong asymmetry in the

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{219-226}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plants have the ability to compensate for damage
   caused by herbivores. This is important to plant growth, because a plant
   cannot always avoid damage, even if it has developed defence mechanisms
   against herbivores. In previous work, we elucidated the
   herbivory-induced compensatory response of Quercus (at both the
   individual shoot and whole sapling levels) in both low- and
   high-nutrient conditions throughout one growing season. In this study,
   we determine how the compensatory growth of Quercus serrata saplings is
   achieved at different nutrient levels.
   Methods Quercus serrata saplings were grown under controlled conditions.
   Length, number of leaves and percentage of leaf area lost on all
   extension units (EUs) were measured.
   Key Results Both the probability of flushing and the length of
   subsequent EUs significantly increased with an increase in the length of
   the parent EU. The probability of flushing increased with an increase in
   leaf damage of the parent EU, but the length of subsequent EUs
   decreased. This indicates that EU growth is fundamentally regulated at
   the individual EU level. The probabilities of a second and third flush
   were significantly higher in plants in high-nutrient soil than those in
   low-nutrient soil. The subsequent EUs of damaged saplings were also
   significantly longer at high-nutrient conditions.
   Conclusions An increase in the probability of flushes in response to
   herbivore damage is important for damaged saplings to produce new EUs;
   further, shortening the length of EUs helps to effectively reproduce
   foliage lost by herbivory. The probability of flushing also varied
   according to soil nutrient levels, suggesting that the compensatory
   growth of individual EUs in response to local damage levels is affected
   by the nutrients available to the whole sapling.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially grown canola, Brassica napus, is negatively affected by

   the relationship between water deficiency and herbivory of two aphid
   species, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach)
   (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on canola. The effect of water deficiency on
   aphid performance was also evaluated. Brassica napus plants were
   provided with either continuous water (well-watered) or were watered
   only once per week (water-deficient). The plants were exposed to either
   B. brassicae, L. erysimi, or no aphids at all. Aphid population
   increase, plant growth, and water relations were measured after 3 weeks.
   Water deficiency reduced plant growth and altered water relations in B.
   napus. Feeding by the aphid L. erysimi substantially reduced growth of
   both water-deficient and well-watered B. napus. However, herbivory by B.
   brassicae reduced plant growth only in conjunction with water
   limitation, demonstrating an interaction between limited water and
   insect infestation on the performance of B. napus. The aphid species and
   water deficiency treatments also differentially affected turgor
   potential, osmotic potential, leaf water potential, and leaf water
   content.
   The two species of aphids responded differently to changes in their host
   plants. The average size and numbers of B. brassicae aphids were lower
   but the percentage of alates was higher on plants with limited water
   relative to those on well-watered plants. The average size and numbers
   of L. erysimi aphids were unaffected by water limitation and the
   percentage of alates produced was slightly reduced in the
   water-deficient plants.
   Water limitation is likely to reduce the growth of plants, particularly
   when B. brassicae infests the crop. However, L. erysimi is probably the
   more serious pest of the two aphids in that it reduced plant growth
   regardless of watering regime and its development was unaffected by the
   status of the host plant.}},

   of the fragmentation, the density of rosettes did not differ between

   in fragments than in control plots in summer but not in late spring and
   early autumn. The extent of leaf damage, expressed as proportion of leaf
   area removed by invertebrate herbivores, increased over the vegetation
   period. Leaf damage was greater in fragments than in control plots at
   two study sites, whereas the opposite (less strongly expressed) was
   found at the third site. Number of species and density (individuals per
   m(2)) of potential herbivores (gastropods and grasshoppers) were

Abstract = {{The effect of herbivory and resource availability on the competitive
   ability of different plant species has been an area of intense debate
   amongst plant ecologists for at least two decades, but the interactive
   effects of herbivory and plant competition between woody and herbaceous
   plants are rarely studied and theory is poorly developed. This study
   used experimental manipulations on transplanted and naturally occurring
   mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) seedlings to
   show the effects of deer browsing and competition from deer-induced,
   herbaceous turf communities on mountain beech regeneration in New
   Zealand. Differences in the species composition of these turfs had
   little effect on mountain beech seedling establishment, but turf removal
   increased seedling growth and survivorship, showing that competition
   with other plants had direct effects on mountain beech regeneration.
   Deer browsing reduced the establishment and growth of seedlings, but the
   size of this effect did not vary with light and nutrient availability.
   There was no immediate compositional response of turf communities
   following the removal of deer browsing. The addition of nutrients
   appeared to reduce the intensity of belowground competition (stem growth
   increased relative to root growth) and increase seedling mortality, but

Abstract = {{1. Effects of sand burial and nutrients on the ability of sand-dune
   willow (Salix cordata) to tolerate or resist herbivory by the beetle
   Altica subplicata were evaluated in field experiments.
   2. To assess tolerance, all combinations of sand burial (none, 50\%),
   nutrients (presence, absence), and beetles (presence, absence) were
   applied to caged plants and growth responses to herbivory were measured.
   Sand burial increased plant growth rate, but decreased S. cordata's
   tolerance to herbivory. Although nutrients increased growth, tolerance
   to herbivory was unaffected.
   3. To assess resistance, plants were exposed to all combinations of sand
   burial and nutrients, and then to natural beetle colonisation. The
   presence of nutrients, but not sand burial, significantly increased the
   percentage of plants with beetles, for both adults and larvae. This
   decreased resistance to beetles of plants grown with added nutrients
   occurred only in the absence of sand burial.
   4. The performance and preference of beetles were examined in laboratory
   experiments. Larvae developed faster and had increased pupation success
   on plants with nutrients added. Beetles also showed a marginally
   significant feeding preference for leaves grown with added nutrients.
   Thus, S. cordata tolerance to herbivory was affected by sand burial,
   whereas resistance, preference, and performance were affected by

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is leading to large-scale changes in
   N availability in terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrogen availability is known
   to affect herbivore consumption rates, insect population dynamics and
   plant response to herbivory, but few studies have investigated these
   factors in combination. I tested the hypotheses that a) simulated N
   deposition alone would positively affect plant performance, b) herbivory
   alone would detrimentally affect plant performance and c) when combined,
   the positive impacts of N deposition would be mitigated by N-induced
   increases in herbivore consumption rates and population sizes. I
   assessed the response of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asteraceae, common
   ragweed) to simulated N deposition and herbivory by aphids and beetles.
   In greenhouse and field studies, I caged multivoltine herbivores on
   plants and allowed damage rates to differ among N treatments due to
   N-driven changes in herbivore populations and consumption rates.
   Simulated N deposition led to increased vegetative and seed biomass and
   decreased root:shoot ratios. Both types of herbivory caused decreases in
   seed biomass, reproductive allocation, and root biomass. The combined
   influences of N deposition and herbivory varied with plant tissue type.
   The positive influences of N deposition on root and seed biomass were
   generally suppressed by herbivory, while positive impacts of N on shoot
   biomass were typically not significantly suppressed by herbivory. These
   data suggest that in addition to substantial direct influences on plant
   production and allocation, N deposition may indirectly affect biomass
   production and allocation through affecting the rates and consequences
   of insect herbivory. However, these strength of these indirect effects
   will differ among herbivore species. The particularly strong influence
   of both herbivory and N deposition on A. artemisiifolia reproduction
   suggest potential population and community-level consequences.}},

Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{In the cases where overcompensation has been observed in monocarpic
   herbs, overcompensation is associated with an apically dominant shoot
   architecture of intact plants, increased lateral branching following
   herbivory, and increased reproductive success as a consequence of
   damage. The compensatory continuum hypothesis expects overcompensation
   to be more prevalent in resource rich environments compared to poor
   environments. This is paradoxical since in resource rich conditions the
   intact plants should branch most vigorously and hence any further
   increase in branch number should lead to lower seed yield. An
   explanation could be that apical dominance is rather insensitive to
   changes in resource availability, and that overcompensation is possible
   in conditions where plants experience meristem limitation (due to apical
   dominance) in relation to available resources.
   We explored the branching patterns and fitness responses of tall
   wormseed mustard (Erysimum strictum) to simulated browsing, soil
   nutrients, and competition in common garden. Competition increased
   apical dominance and reduced plant fitness whereas fertilization had the
   reverse effects. Simulated browsing increased lateral branching and had
   little impact on plant fitness. Fitness overcompensation was observed
   only among plants grown in competition and in the absence of
   fertilization - the most resource poor treatment combination in the
   experiment. The results contradict both with the compensation continuum
   and the assumption that apical dominance shows no or very little
   plasticity in relation to growing conditions. Because directional
   selection gradients on branch number were invariantly positive
   irrespective of growing conditions, we propose that, in spite of
   phenotypic plasticity of apical dominance, the plants appear to be
   meristem rather than resource limited, and that meristem limitation is
   strongest in conditions where intact plants produce fewest lateral
   branches. Our results deviate from the compensation continuum because
   resource availability affected compensation ability more strongly
   through phenotypic plasticity of shoot architecture rather than via
   changes in resource availability per se.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Autotrophic biomass is often regulated by resource supply and consumer
   presence. Most studies on top-down vs. bottom-up control of plant
   biomass focus on nutrients as basal resources, whereas light has
   received considerably less attention.
   Effects of light and nutrients may differ because light represents a
   vertical resource and plant adaptations to acquire light might
   counteract or facilitate consumer effects. I tested the interaction
   between light supply and consumer presence in a meta-analysis of
   experiments that manipulated both these factors factorially and measured
   the biomass of benthic algae (periphyton).
   Both grazer removal and light enhancement had positive effects on algal
   biomass. These two factors showed strong interactions, which exceeded
   previously observed interaction terms between nutrient supply and grazer
   removal. Positive light effects on algal biomass were primarily observed
   in the absence of grazers. Grazer effects became stronger at high light
   supply, which indicated that high light favours algal growth types that
   are easily ingested.
   Further analyses showed that light effects increased with trophic state
   of the habitat and with algal biomass, indicating enhanced importance of
   light limitation and self-shading at high nutrient supply. Grazer
   effects depended on grazer biomass and varied with type of experimental
   manipulation.
   This study implies that light is of similar importance as nutrients in
   resource control of benthic algal biomass. High light levels
   simultaneously enhance consumer control of algal biomass, resulting in
   strong resource vs. consumer interactions. Light competition and
   consumer presence pose a trade-off on algal growth, where growth form
   may distinguish between adaptations to acquire light and to avoid
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Although ungulate herbivory influences forest dynamics over a variety of
   spatial and temporal scales, relatively few models have been developed
   for investigating browsing effects on tree regeneration processes. We
   describe a new, mechanistic model (HUNGER) that modifies a
   well-established mathematical formulation for plant nutrient transport
   and conversion processes to simulate sapling response to ungulate
   browsing and light availability. The HUNGER model simulates primary
   production, height and diameter growth, dry matter allocation, and
   population dynamics of tree saplings at the scale of small (e.g. 0.001
   ha) regeneration patches.
   The model was applied to Picea abies saplings in mountain forests of
   eastern Switzerland after calibration based on data for sapling height
   growth, radial growth, and biomass components under varying light
   conditions. Independent data were used to test the ability of the model
   to represent sapling responses to browsing. The model slightly
   over-predicted sapling height, while no significant differences were
   found between simulated and observed basal diameter, total biomass or
   leaf biomass. Model experiments were conducted to explore the
   interactive effects of winter browsing intensity and relative light
   availability upon sapling net growth. Simulated shading effects were
   gradual until approximately 40\% relative light availability (if
   browsing pressure was low) or 60\% relative light availability (if
   browsing pressure was high). Below these values, the model simulates
   sharp declines in net growth rate. Model results suggest nonlinear
   responses to browsing and light availability, and the existence of light
   intensity thresholds for forest regeneration that should be relevant for
   management activities affecting deer density and crown cover. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Exhaustive analyses of plant-frugivore systems have revealed that few,
   if any, of these plant-animal interactions are tightly coevolved. Such
   lack of coevolutionary evidence could be related to frugivores selecting
   plants based on environmental cues, rather than on plant phenotypic
   traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, I examined whether the pattern and
   extent of fruit predation by long-tailed field mice (Apodemus
   sylvaticus) on the perennial herb Helleborus foetidus was directly
   related to mouse abundance, to environmental cues, to plant phenotypic
   traits, or to a combination of these. Thus, I estimated mouse relative
   abundance (through livetrapping) and percentages of fruit predation by
   mice, and quantified plant environmental and phenotypic traits in 9
   populations of H. foetidus in southeastern Spain during 2 years
   (overall, 254 plants). I found substantial variation among populations
   in mouse trapping success (ranging from 0.0 to 21.8 individuals/100 trap
   nights), size of fruit crops (8.6-28.9 fruits per plant), and
   percentages of fruit predation by mice (0.0-93.3\%). However, no simple
   relationship was found between mouse abundance (as estimated by trapping
   success) and strength of fruit predation. None of the 4 measured plant
   phenotypic traits (e.g., number of fruits or plant size) had a
   significant effect on mouse foraging. Conversely, 2 of the 6
   environmental traits considered (substrate and distance to nearest tree)
   influenced fruit predation by mice. Plants located on rocky substrates
   and nearby trees experienced higher percentages of predation and this
   result was rather consistent across the 2 years and the 2 levels
   considered (inter- and intrapopulation). Even though mice could have
   selected other plant phenotypic traits not accounted for (e.g., chemical
   traits), such hypothetical phenotypic selection appears to be
   inconsequential as a source of individual variation in H. foetidus
   maternal fitness because its effects could have been ``diluted{''} by
   the overwhelming influence of environmental factors. Thus, the results
   support the initial hypothesis that the net outcomes of the interaction
   between H. foetidus and mice in southeastern Spain may not have strong
   coevolutionary consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The impact that herbivore damage has on plant fitness depends on the
   environmental conditions in which the plant is growing. It has long been
   assumed that a plant's tolerance of herbivory should be greater in
   low-stress, resource-rich environments, and this assumption has been
   formalized in what has become known as the compensatory continuum
   hypothesis (CCH). Despite the widespread acceptance of the CCH, recently
   accumulating results from numerous studies relating resource levels to
   tolerance of herbivory show that the relationship is not as simple as
   this hypothesis predicts. In fact, plants have often been found to be
   less tolerant of a given amount of herbivory in resource-rich
   environments than they are of the same amount of herbivory in
   resource-poor environments. In this article, we present a new model, the
   limiting resource model (LRM), that can more reliably explain the range
   of observed effects of resource levels on tolerance. The main advance of
   this model is that it specifically considers which factors are limiting
   plant fitness and which resources are affected by particular herbivores.
   The LRM is presented in a general and flexible form as a flowchart with
   seven pathways to three potential outcomes: greater tolerance, equal
   tolerance, or lower tolerance in low- vs high-resource environments. We
   then review a specific example to illustrate each of these seven
   pathways with a study from the published literature. We finish with a
   description of four general criteria to direct the design of future
   studies to test the predictions of the LRM.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores highly reduce the performance of many plant species. However,
   little empirical information exists on the real effect that these
   organisms have on plant populations. With a long-term (seven-year)
   ungulate exclusion experiment in two areas of southeastern Spain, I
   demonstrated that these organisms can affect not only individual
   performance, but also the population dynamics and spatial structure of
   two short-lived monocarpic herbs, Erysimum mediohispanicum and E.
   baeticum. There was between-year and among-microhabitat variability in
   damage, with plants growing under shrubs being less damaged than those
   growing in open sites. Ungulates consumed flowers and fruits, severely
   decreasing plant reproductive output. The postdispersal seed predation
   rate increased after ungulates were excluded, presumably as a
   consequence of the relaxation of competition between seed predators and
   ungulates. The effect of ungulates on Erysimum early establishment was
   nonsignificant, although \&GT; 50\% of Erysimum seedlings died due to
   ungulate trampling. The exclusion experiment also revealed that, as a
   consequence of their impact on seed production, ungulates affected the
   population dynamics of their host plants; their removal produced a
   significant increase in the abundance of the two studied plant species.
   Furthermore, habitat distribution of plants was also influenced by the
   activity of ungulates. In control plots, most Erysimum individuals grew
   under the canopy of co-occurring shrubs. In contrast, a dramatic spatial
   redistribution of plants occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, where they
   started to colonize open sites. Consequently, the spatial structure of
   the plants excluded from ungulates significantly differed from that in
   control plots and became statistically similar to the structure expected
   according to the cover of every microhabitat. Finally, this experiment
   revealed that, for plants inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, abundance
   and spatial structure are tightly related. Thus, I found that abundance
   increased in ungulate-excluded plots due not to a general and
   homogeneous increase, but to a significant increase in those
   microhabitats inaccessible to ungulates in control plots. These findings
   suggest that herbivory effects on plants are intricate, affecting not
   only their performance or population dynamics, but also their habitat
   distribution and niche structure.}},

Abstract = {{In biennial plants, the age of flowering is constrained, but size at
   flowering is highly variable. This suggests that performance at the
   flowering stage depends largely on growth conditions at the rosette
   stage. We examined this possibility using Erysimum strictum P. Gaertn.,
   B. Mey., and Scherb. (Brassicaceae), a strictly biennial herb, the
   reproductive output of which increases with increasing plant height and
   branch number. In a common garden experiment, we defoliated (50\% of
   leaves removed twice) and fertilized (three times) individual plants at
   the rosette stage and studied their performance at the flowering stage
   in the following year. Rosette defoliation adversely affected all
   performance measures except seed number per fruit and seed weight.
   Fertilization did not alleviate these effects. Defoliation reduced seed
   set by 48\% in fertilized plants and 29\% in unfertilized plants.
   Fertilization stimulated branch production from the rosette base but did
   not significantly affect plant height. These observations suggest that,
   in the case of basally unbranched plants, apical dominance by the
   leading stalk suppresses the axillary meristems at the rosette base.
   Fertilization at the rosette stage can break this suppression. The
   induction for breakage presumably occurs before bolting since, in our
   earlier experiments, neither fertilization nor apical damage at the
   flowering stage stimulated branching from the base. Erysimum strictum is
   likely to be selected for fast vertical growth at the start of bolting,
   and hence plant height is a less plastic trait with respect to resource
   availability than branch number. Regression analysis suggested that, in
   response to rosette fertilization, small plants invest in height growth
   instead of branching, whereas large plants to a greater extent invest
   their supplemental resources in vigorous branching. Consequently,
   resource availability at the rosette stage influences apical dominance
   at the flowering stage. Unexpectedly, however, improved resource
   availability did not alleviate the cost of simulated rosette-stage
   herbivory.}},

   thaliana genotype and the isogenic herbivore-sensitive A. thaliana
   genotype. It was concluded that herbivory had a significant effect on
   the fecundity of the susceptible genotype at high plant density. The
   most likely long-term scenario was that the susceptible genotype
   outcompeted the resistant genotype. But it was also shown that herbivory
   could down-regulate the equilibrium density of the susceptible genotype
   and, when the two genotypes were coexisting, up-regulate the equilibrium
   density of the resistant genotype.}},

Abstract = {{We studied consequences of storm damage on buttonwood (Conocarpus
   erectus) shrubs and their herbivores in the Bahamian islands. Buttonwood
   is polymorphic, with green shrubs producing few leaf trichomes and
   silver shrubs covered in dense trichomes. We first characterize traits
   of green vs. silver shrubs relevant for herbivores, and then assay
   damage by two prominent insects. Next, on replicated islands, we
   experimentally address how different types of storm damage (simulated
   hurricane surge damage vs. simulated intense wind) affected phenotypic
   traits of both buttonwood morphs and subsequent herbivory over a
   one-year sampling period. Our results show that although leaves produced
   by green shrubs are 21\% tougher than leaves produced by silver shrubs,
   green leaves have 16\% higher nitrogen concentrations and greater levels
   of herbivory. Consistent with previous observational studies of a
   natural hurricane at our study site, we found stronger effects of
   simulated surge damage than simulated wind damage. Experimental pruning
   of shrubs resulted in reduced toughness, higher nitrogen concentration,
   fewer trichomes, and greater herbivory compared to controls and compared
   to shrubs with their leaves stripped. The results were stronger for the
   silver compared to the green morph. Morph differences in buttonwood have
   strong consequences for herbivores, and these effects are modified by
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{1. The study of the impact of herbivory on plant fitness and its
   relationship with environmental conditions is essential to an
   understanding of the ecological and evolutionary routes in different
   populations of the same plant species. This paper addresses the effects
   of herbivory and environment on growth (leaf production) and floral
   display (inflorescence production) in the tropical aroid Anthurium
   schlechtendalii ssp. schlechtendalii Kunth (Araceae).
   2. Defoliation experiments were conducted in three natural A.
   schlechtendalii populations in Mexico: coastal sand dunes (Telchac);
   thorny dry forest (Dzemul); and medium-height subhumid forest (Hobonil).
   Experiments were also conducted under common-garden conditions using
   plants transplanted from the three populations.
   3. Logistic regression models showed that herbivory did not affect
   growth negatively, but did affect floral display in A. schlechtendalii.
   The effect on floral display differed as a function of environment,
   damage intensity and season. When the plants experienced no resource
   limitation (common garden), herbivory inhibited inflorescence production
   in the first season (2001) and at the highest damage level (75\%). When
   plants experienced heterogeneous resource conditions (field experiment),
   inflorescence production was inhibited in the second season (2002) at
   intermediate damage intensities.
   4. Overall, A. schlechtendalii plants maintained growth regardless of
   damage intensity, but inflorescence production was reduced, indicating a
   trade-off between growth and floral display due to herbivory. Results
   also suggested that plants were constrained in their response by the
   environmental history of their native site.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{824-834}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1 Plant community development depends to a great extent on the
   availability of soil nutrients, but recent studies underline the role of
   symbiotic, herbivorous and pathogenic soil biota. We tested for
   interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors by studying the
   effects of additional nutrients and the removal of soil biota on the
   replacement of grassland plant species typical of different successional
   stages.
   2 Species representing each of the early, mid and target phases of
   secondary succession in a grassland community (four per phase) were
   grown in mid-successional grassland soil. The mixed plant communities
   were grown in sterilized and non-sterilized soil, at three nutrient
   supply levels. The distribution of shoot biomass over the different
   plant species, and the total root biomass, were determined, as well as
   the composition of nematode and microarthropod communities and soil
   decomposition rates.
   3 The effect of nutrient supply on plant community composition depended
   on soil sterilization. In sterilized soil, the plant community was
   initially dominated by grasses that increased in dominance even without
   fertilization. In non-sterilized soil, the plant community was more
   diverse and grass dominance decreased over time, except with high
   fertilization. Fertilization enhanced the productivity of the plant
   community in sterilized and, to a greater extent, in non-sterilized
   soil.
   4 The abundance of root-feeding nematodes was positively related to
   increased root biomass, pointing to a strong bottom-up control.
   Increased levels of nutrient supply were associated with reduced
   abundance of omnivorous nematodes, the cause of this reduction being
   less clear. Increased soil fertility altered the functional diversity of
   the soil nematode community, which might, in the longer term, also
   affect their feedback effects on the plant community.
   5 Increased nutrient supply reduced soil decomposition activity in the
   non-sterilized soil, but not in the sterilized soil.
   6 Our results imply that soil biota may reduce the effects of nutrient
   supply on plant dominance. Incorporating the effects of soil biota on
   plant species interactions into studies on succession, plant species
   diversity and restoration may therefore considerably increase our
   understanding of the observed plant community patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggests that
   herbivory in general and mammalian winter herbivory in particular is
   important in arctic-alpine ecosystems. Although knowledge of the effect
   of herbivores on specific plants and communities is quite extensive,
   little is known about the relative impact of large and small vertebrate
   herbivores and how it might vary among different habitats. To address
   this key issue, we established exclosures with two different mesh sizes
   in forest and nearby tundra at three different sites in four contrasting
   locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and
   Norway. Plant community composition was recorded annually in three
   permanent plots within each exclosure and an unfenced control. Local
   densities of vertebrate herbivores were estimated in spring and autumn
   from 1998 to 2002.
   Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) were the most abundant large vertebrate
   while Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and grey-sided voles
   (Clethrionomys rufocanus) were the most common small vertebrates. The
   study reveals that voles and lemmings have larger effects on the
   vegetation than reindeer in both habitats in all four locations, even
   though densities of reindeer differ between locations and only two
   locations experienced lemming peaks during the period of the experiment.
   The relative abundance of five of the fifteen most common species was
   significantly influenced by voles and lemmings whereas only a single
   species was significantly influenced by reindeer. Different analyses
   give contrasting results on the importance of herbivory in forest versus
   open heathlands. A principal component analyses revealed that herbivory
   influenced the vegetation more in open heathlands than in forests.
   However, an importance index of herbivores did not differ between forest
   and open heathlands. Moreover, none of the plant species responded
   differently in the two habitats, when herbivores were removed. Our
   results suggest that intense and localised selective foraging by small
   mammals may have a more marked effect on vegetation than transient
   feeding by reindeer.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivore impacts on plants are predicted to be greatest in competitive
   and stressful environments. Plant neighbors can exert strong
   facilitative as well as competitive effects, however, and facilitation
   is often mediated through the reduction of environmental stresses. Thus,
   neighbors may simultaneously increase plant compensation for herbivory,
   by reducing environmental stress, and reduce compensation by competing
   for resources. To determine whether aboveground competition and
   facilitation influence the ability of an annual forb, Atriplex patula
   var. hastata, to compensate for herbivory, I performed a field
   experiment in which the presence of insect herbivores and plant
   neighbors were manipulated in a factorial design. The, neighbor
   treatments included removal of dominant rushes (cleared), rushes left
   intact (vegetated), and rush removal, plus reduction of environmental
   stress by shading of the soil surface (buffered). In cleared treatments,
   herbivory reduced survival by almost 50\% and reproduction by 37\%. In
   contrast herbivory had no significant effects on plant survival or
   reproductive output in buffered treatments. Thus, facilitation through
   soil shading increased plant compensation for herbivory. However,
   herbivores also strongly reduced fruit production (45\%) in vegetated
   treatments, suggesting that competition magnifies herbivore impacts. The
   results demonstrate that neighboring plants can simultaneously increase
   and decrease plant tolerance to herbivory.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{234-240}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Boreal forest trees are highly dependent on root-colonizing mycorrhizal
   fungi. Since the maintenance of mycorrhizal symbiosis implies a
   significant carbon cost for the host plant, the loss of photosynthetic
   leaf area due to herbivory is expected to reduce the host investment in
   mycorrhizae. We tested this hypothesis in a common garden experiment by
   exposing ectomycorrhizal white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings
   to simulated insect defoliation of 50 or 100\% intensity during either
   the previous or the current summer or repeatedly during both seasons
   before harvest. The shoot and root growth of the seedlings were
   distinctly reduced by both 100\% defoliation and repeated 50\%
   defoliation, and they were more strongly affected by previous-year than
   current-year defoliation. The root to shoot ratio significantly
   decreased after 100\% defoliation, indicating reduced proportional
   allocation to the roots. Ergosterol concentration (i.e. fungal biomass)
   in the fine roots decreased by 100\% defoliation conducted either in the
   year of harvest or in both years. No such decrease occurred following
   the 100\% defoliation conducted in the previous year, indicating the
   importance of current photosynthates for fungal symbionts. The trend was
   similar in the colonization percentage of thickmantled mycorrhizae in
   the roots, the most marked decline occurring in the repeatedly
   defoliated seedlings. The present results thus support the prediction
   that the plant investment in ectomycorrhizae may decline as a response
   to foliage loss. Moreover, the colonization percentage of thick-mantled
   mycorrhizae correlated positively with the ratio of leaf to
   heterotrophic plant biomass in the defoliated birch seedlings, but not
   in the control ones. This tends to indicate a stronger carbon limitation
   of ectomycorrhizal colonization in defoliated seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the allocation of net production to plant secondary

   species in Borneo vis-A-vis the resource availability hypothesis. In
   particular, we focused on Borneo ironwood (Eusideroxylon zwageri,
   Lauraceae), which seemed to employ an extreme defensive strategy. The
   wood of this species is extremely durable and has a high specific
   gravity with a very slow growth rate. The allocation to defense by
   Borneo ironwood was compared to two emergent species of
   Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family in this forest community. We
   conducted shade-house experiments on seedlings under four controlled
   conditions (two light levels x two nutrient levels) and showed that the
   growth rate of E. zwageri was much lower than those of the other two
   species, and it allocated more of its net production to leaves and roots
   than to stems. The concentrations of condensed tannins and lignins were
   very high in the leaves and stems of this species, at about 20 and 30\%,
   respectively. In total, E. zwageri allocated a maximum of about 35\% of
   its net production to defensive substances (i.e., condensed tannins +
   lignins). In contrast, the two dipterocarp species allocated about
   20-25\% of their net production to defensive substances. The condensed
   tannins in E. zwageri help to prolong the lifespan of the leaves, and
   the lignins in the stems enhance the durability of the wood. Thus,
   although E. zwageri grows very slowly, the allocation to defensive
   substances seems to be an advantageous strategy for survival under dark

Abstract = {{Biological control with specialist, nonindigenous, herbivorous insects
   is an important option for controlling invasive exotic plants in
   wildlands and nature reserves. It is assumed that biological control
   agents will reduce the dominance of the target weed, thereby increasing
   the native diversity of the associated plant community. However, this
   hypothesis has rarely been tested. We introduced Aphthona nigriscutis
   into grassland sites infested with the invasive ex otic species
   Euphorbia esula L. on a nature reserve in Montana (U.S.A.). Two sites
   with better soil bad been treated previously with herbicide, whereas two
   other sites had not. We measured the density and biomass of Euphorbia
   vegetative and flowering stems and number of native and exotic shrubs,
   grass-like plants, and forbs in 48 microplots in Aphthona release and
   control macroplots at each site. After 5 years, Aphthona release was
   associated with a 33-39\% decline in Euphorbia aboveground biomass
   compared with controls at all sites. Other effects of the biocontrol
   depended on the site. Biocontrol slowed the recovery of species
   diversity at the sites previously treated with herbicide but slowed the
   loss of diversity at sites without a history of herbicide. Biocontrol
   introduction was not associated with a disproportionate increase in
   nontarget exotic species. Release of Aphthona caused a decline in the
   biomass of flowering stems relative to controls at good-soil,
   previous-herbicide sites but was associated with a relative increase in
   flower stem mass at poor-soil, no-herbicide sites. Our results suggest
   that biocontrol reductions in weed dominance will not always be
   associated with increased species diversity. More emphasis should be
   placed on conserving desirable communities and less on simple weed
   control. Monitoring of community-level effects should accompany
   biocontrol introductions on nature reserves.}},

   little direct effects on plant biomass, it did interact with competition
   to affect growth for three of the four species. Herbivory reduced the
   strength of competition experienced by Coreopsis, but increased it in
   Linum. For both Coreopsis and Helianthus, the combined effects of
   herbivory and competition on plant growth were less than expected from a
   simple multiplicative response.
   5 We suggest that interactions were found because we used an
   experimental design that modified insect densities on both neighbours
   and the focal plant, allowing for determination of both direct and
   indirect effects.
   6 We suggest that the antagonistic interactions between competition and
   herbivory may have occurred because herbivores altered the competitive
   environment by harming the neighbouring plants, or because the presence
   of neighbours facilitated focal plant growth by distributing herbivore
   loads over the greater amount of plant biomass available.
   7 Although as an isolated factor competition is more intense in this
   system than insect herbivory, herbivory can alter the strength of
   competitive interactions and thus its importance cannot be determined by
   measuring intensity alone. This result emphasizes that these two
   ecological processes are not truly discrete, and further suggests that
   studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple ecological processes are
   needed.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{104}},

Pages = {{247-268}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We conducted a meta-analysis of 68 studies published between 1982 and
   2000 in which the responses of woody plants to natural or simulated
   herbivore damage and/or insect herbivore performance on control and
   damaged plants were measured. Cumulative meta-analyses revealed dramatic
   temporal changes in the magnitude and direction of the plant and
   herbivore responses reported during the last two decades. Studies
   conducted in the 1980s reported increase in phenolic concentrations,
   reduction in nutrient concentrations and negative effect on herbivore
   performance, consistently with the idea of induced resistance. In
   contrast, in the early 1990s when the idea that some types of plant
   damage may result in induced susceptibility was generally accepted,
   studies reported non-significant results or induced susceptibility, and
   smaller effects on herbivores. The above changes may reflect paradigm
   shifts in the theory of induced defenses and/or the differences between
   study systems used in the early and the more recent studies. Overall,
   plant growth and carbohydrate concentrations were reduced in damaged
   plants despite enhanced photosynthetic rates. Damage increased the
   concentrations of carbon and phenolics, while terpene concentrations
   tended to decrease after damage; changes in nutrient concentrations
   after damage varied according to nutrient mobility, inherent plant
   growth rate, ontogenetic stage and plant type (deciduous/evergreen).
   Early season damage caused more pronounced changes in plants than late
   season damage, which is in accordance with the assumption that
   vigorously growing foliage has a greater capacity to respond to damage.
   Insect growth rate and female pupal weight decreased on previously
   damaged plants, while herbivore survival, consumption and male pupal
   weight were not significantly affected. The magnitude and direction of
   herbivore responses depended on the type of plant, the type of damage,
   the time interval between the damage and insect feeding (rapid/delayed
   induced resistance), and the timing of the damage.}},

Title = {{Tolerance of an annual hemiparasite, Euphrasia stricta agg., to
   simulated grazing in relation to the host environment}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{199}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{247-255}},
Abstract = {{Many annual plants are adapted to man-made habitats, such as grazed and
   mown meadows, because they are poor competitors and hence confined to
   relatively open habitats with low vegetation. In order to survive in
   grazed and mown habitats, they should also have evolved tolerance to
   apical damage. We studied the tolerance of eyebright (Euphrasia stricta
   agg.), a hemiparasitic annual, to varying intensities of apical damage
   (0\%, 10\% and 50\% cutting) in a common garden experiment in two
   consecutive seasons with Trifolium repens and Festuca rubra as available
   hosts. The host environment was manipulated by mowing or by leaving the
   surrounding vegetation intact.
   Because root hemiparasitic plants poach resources from their host
   plants, while the hosts are simultaneously also potential competitors
   for light, mowing of the surrounding vegetation may have both negative
   (less host resources available) and positive (reduced competition)
   effects on hemiparasites. In the present study, neighbourhood mowing
   tended to improve the growth and fruit production of apically damaged
   eyebright plants. In the first study year, apically damaged (10\% cut)
   plants produced more branches, higher shoot biomass and more fruits
   compared to intact plants when the surrounding vegetation was mown. No
   such overcompensation was observed either in an unmown neighbourhood or
   in the second year. The plants tolerated more extensive damage less
   well, and all of the 50\% cut plants died in the second year in the
   unmown neighbourhood. The poor survival of these plants was likely to be
   due to the unfavourable combination of heavy damage, summer drought and
   competition with the surrounding vegetation.
   The present study suggests that Euphrasia, and possibly also other
   annual meadow herbs, may tolerate relatively well minor apical damage,
   while more extensive damage is likely to adversely affect their
   performance. The results also support a compensatory continuum in which
   grazing tolerance varies from undercompensation (damage decreases plant
   performance) in unfavourable conditions to overcompensation (damage
   increases plant performance) in favourable growing conditions. While
   tolerance to apical damage may contribute to the success of these
   species, they are poor competitors, and their long-term persistence may
   hence notably depend on the fact that grazing, and mowing suppress
   stronger competitors by maintaining low vegetation.}},

   responses}},
Journal = {{NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{343-356}},
Abstract = {{Bear Oak (Quercus ilicifolia Wang.) presents a unique architecture in
   which there is a distinct outer set of leaves on the perimeter of the
   bush and another set of leaves on the inside. In this paper we examine
   the relationship between plant architecture, leaf-level physiology, and
   leaf damage patterns by insects. We measured net photosynthesis,
   stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential in response to different
   levels of herbivory or leaf-rolling in both outer- and inner-canopy
   leaves. Leaf-rolling occurred naturally and was mimicked by hand-rolling
   leaves to different degrees. Net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance,
   and leaf water potential varied depending upon a combination of leaf
   position in the crown and degree of rolling, but not herbivory.
   Outer-canopy leaves had significantly higher rates of net photosynthesis
   and stomatal conductance, but lower leaf water potentials and leaf areas
   than inner-canopy leaves. Leaf rolling had an effect upon photosynthesis
   and stomatal conductance, which varied depending on whether projected
   areas of rolled leaves or projected areas of the leaves after they had
   been unrolled were considered. In both canopy layers, using unrolled
   projected leaf areas, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis
   decreased with increasing leaf rolling. In the outer canopy, using
   projected areas of rolled leaves, photosynthesis decreased while
   stomatal conductance increased with increasing leaf rolling. In the
   inner canopy, photosynthesis increased while stomatal conductance was
   unchanged with increasing leaf rolling. In all cases, leaf water
   potential increased with increasing leaf rolling. These results suggest
   (in order of likelihood) that either rolling creates an area of closed
   stomata (stomatal patchiness) proportional to the amount of rolling, or
   leaf specific hydraulic conductance increases, or stomata are responding
   to changes in the boundary layer of the leaf.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to identify the degree to which the frequency
   and timing of herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
   and subsequent plant response varied across 12 populations of the
   perennial herb Trillium grandiflorum. Effects of natural and
   experimental herbivory on the stage and size of reproductive plants were
   measured. Both the frequency and timing of herbivory varied across T.
   grandiflorum populations. Reproductive plants were more likely to
   regress to nonreproductive stages in the next growing season when (1)
   reproductive plants were consumed by deer (vs. intact reproductive
   plants); (2) reproductive plants were consumed early in the growing
   season (vs. reproductive plants consumed late in the growing season);
   (3) reproductive plants were smaller in size. Clipped plants that
   remained reproductive were smaller in the following season than
   unclipped controls. Plant size was positively correlated with the number
   of ovules, suggesting that reductions in the growth rate of reproductive
   plants diminish their future reproductive success. Populations with high
   levels of natural herbivory had a greater proportion of reproductive
   plants that regressed to nonreproductive stages, probably because
   reproductive plants in these populations were smaller in size. However,
   the plant response to herbivory was similar across populations.}},

Abstract = {{Co-adaptations, co-evolution, and co-speciation between herbivores and
   their host plants have been topics of interest for several decades.
   Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as
   physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous
   insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic
   environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of
   genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies
   (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance,
   but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological,
   biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic
   introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was
   documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of
   regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other
   genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in
   speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties
   identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any
   species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as `key
   innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different
   polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant
   availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range
   distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically
   categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations
   for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various
   `species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes
   could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted,
   co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and
   changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely
   related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could
   explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone
   for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-36}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Endophytic fungi, especially asexual, systemic endophytes in grasses,
   are generally viewed as plant mutualists, mainly through the action of
   mycotoxins, such as alkaloids in infected grasses, which protect the
   host plant from herbivores. Most of the evidence for the defensive
   mutualism concept is derived from studies of agronomic grass cultivars,
   which may be atypical of many endophyte-host interactions. I argue that
   endophytes in native plants, even asexual, seed-borne ones, rarely act
   as defensive mutualists. In contrast to domesticated grasses where
   infection frequencies of highly toxic plants often approach 100\%,
   natural grass populations are usually mosaics of uninfected and infected
   plants. The latter, however, usually vary enormously in alkaloid levels,
   from none to levels that may affect herbivores. This variation may
   result from diverse endophyte and host genotypic combinations that are
   maintained by changing selective pressures, such as competition,
   herbivory and abiotic factors. Other processes, such as spatial
   structuring of host populations and endophytes that act as reproductive
   parasites of their hosts, may maintain infection levels of seed-borne
   endophytes in natural populations, without the endophyte acting as a
   mutualist.}},
