Abstract = {{Selection mediated by one biotic agent will often be modified by the
   presence of other biotic interactions, and the importance of such
   indirect effects might change over time. We conducted an 11-yr field
   experiment to test the prediction that large grazers affect selection on
   floral display of the dimorphic herb Primula farinosa not only directly
   through differential grazing damage, but also indirectly by affecting
   vegetation height and thereby selection mediated by pollinators and seed
   predators. Exclusion of large grazers increased vegetation height and
   the strength of pollinator-mediated selection for tall inflorescences
   and seed-predator-mediated selection for short inflorescences. The
   direct effect of grazers on selection resulting from differential
   grazing damage to the two scape morphs showed no temporal trend. By
   contrast, the increase in vegetation height in exclosures over time was
   associated with an increase in selection mediated by pollinators and
   seed predators. In the early years of the experiment, the indirect
   effects of grazers on selection mediated by pollinators and seed
   predators were weak, whereas at the end of the experiment, the indirect
   effects were of similar magnitude as the direct effect due to
   differential grazing damage. The results demonstrate that the indirect
   effects of a selective agent can be as strong as its direct effects, and
   that the relative importance of direct vs. indirect effects on selection
   can change over time. A full understanding of the ecological processes
   governing variation in selection thus requires that both direct and
   indirect effects of biotic interactions are assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is thought to promote
   plant species diversity. Theoretical studies showing the importance of
   CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD;
   however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly
   in their susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that
   interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on
   diversity. First, if the most common species are the least regulated by
   CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed
   dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible to CNDD are at a
   competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from
   a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the
   competitive inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may
   undermine many species' ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests
   that variable CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more
   stable.}},

Abstract = {{Plants face a range of trade-offs as they attempt to maximize their
   fitness within a complex web composed of competitors, mutualists, and
   herbivores. In addition to growth-defense and competition-defense
   trade-offs, plants must balance their response to a wide range of
   potential enemies including pathogens and vertebrate and invertebrate
   herbivores. We tested for trade-offs in plant species' responses to
   different types of consumers using a foodweb manipulation experiment in
   which we selectively excluded large vertebrate herbivores and removed
   foliar fungi, soil fungi, and insects from natural and experimentally
   planted grassland communities. We found no evidence for trade-offs in
   the ability of plants to defend themselves against different sets of
   consumers, although plants varied widely in their responses to removal
   of different consumer groups. In addition, the species-level responses
   to consumer removal in monoculture were uncorrelated with each species'
   response in more diverse communities, highlighting the important role of
   local context (e.g., competition and apparent competition) in
   determining the effects of consumers. Plants must balance their
   allocation of energy among a wide variety of tasks including growing,
   competing for limited resources, and defending themselves against an
   array of potential enemies. We found that while plant species differed
   greatly in their response to the removal of consumers, species that were
   susceptible to the effects of one consumer group (e.g., insect
   herbivores) also were susceptible to other consumer groups (e.g., fungal
   pathogens). This suggests that plants differ in their overall allocation
   to defense, but defense investment can proffer protection against a wide
   array of natural enemies. We also found that plant responses to
   consumers depended on the diversity of the surrounding plant community,
   suggesting that among-plant interactions can alter their susceptibility
   to the impacts of consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualists may play an important role in invasion success. The ability

   has invaded five continents. We performed two plant growth experiments
   with Medicago polymorpha, inoculating them with soil slurries in one
   experiment or rhizobial cultures in another experiment. For both
   experiments, we compared the growth of Medicago in competition with
   conspecific or heterospecific plants and examined variation among plant
   genotypes collected from the native and introduced ranges. We found that
   all genotypes experienced similar increases in biomass and formed more
   nodules that house rhizobia bacteria when inoculated with soil from a
   previously invaded site, compared to uninoculated plants or plants
   inoculated with soil from uninvaded and low invasion sites. In a second
   experiment, plants inoculated with rhizobia generally produced more
   biomass, had greater tolerance to interspecific competition, and had
   greater effects on competitor biomass than uninoculated plants. However,
   plant genotypes collected from the native range benefited more from
   rhizobia and were less tolerant of competition relative to genotypes
   collected from the introduced range. In the introduced range, compatible
   mutualists may not be readily available but competition is intense,
   causing Medicago to evolve to benefit less from interactions with
   rhizobia mutualists, while simultaneously becoming more tolerant of

Abstract = {{Forests make up a large portion of terrestrial plant biomass, and the
   long-lived woody plants that dominate them possess an array of traits
   that deter consumption by forest pests. Although often extremely
   effective against native consumers, invasive species that avoid or
   overcome these defenses can wreak havoc on trees and surrounding
   ecosystems. This is especially true when multiple invasive species
   co-occur, since interactions between invasive herbivores may yield
   non-additive effects on the host. While the threat posed by invasive
   forest pests is well known, long-term field experiments are necessary to
   explore these consumer-host interactions at appropriate spatial and
   temporal scales. Moreover, it is important to measure multiple variables
   to get a ``whole-plant{''} picture of their combined impact. We report
   the results of a 4-yr field experiment addressing the individual and
   combined impacts of two invasive herbivores, the hemlock woolly adelgid
   (Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa), on
   native eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in southern New England. In
   2011, we planted 200 hemlock saplings into a temperate forest understory
   and experimentally manipulated the presence/absence of both herbivore
   species; in 2015, we harvested the 88 remaining saplings and assessed
   plant physiology, growth, and resource allocation. Adelgids strongly
   affected hemlock growth: infested saplings had lower above/belowground
   biomass ratios, more needle loss, and produced fewer new needles than
   control saplings. Hemlock scale did not alter plant biomass allocation
   or growth, and its co-occurrence did not alter the impact of adelgid.
   While both adelgid and scale impacted the concentrations of primary
   metabolites, adelgid effects were more pronounced. Adelgid feeding
   simultaneously increased free amino acids local to feeding sites and a
   similar to 30\% reduction in starch. The cumulative impact of
   adelgid-induced needle loss, manipulation of nitrogen pools, and the
   loss of stored resources likely accelerates host decline through
   disruption of homeostatic source-sink dynamics occurring at the
   whole-plant level. Our research stresses the importance of considering
   long-term impacts to predict how plants will cope with contemporary
   pressures experienced in disturbed forests.}},

Abstract = {{Plants interact simultaneously with each other and with soil biota, yet
   the relative importance of competition vs. plant-soil feedback (PSF) on
   plant performance is poorly understood. Using a meta-analysis of 38
   published studies and 150 plant species, we show that effects of
   interspecific competition (either growing plants with a competitor or
   singly, or comparing inter- vs. intraspecific competition) and PSF
   (comparing home vs. away soil, live vs. sterile soil, or control vs.
   fungicide-treated soil) depended on treatments but were predominantly
   negative, broadly comparable in magnitude, and additive or synergistic.
   Stronger competitors experienced more negative PSF than weaker
   competitors when controlling for density (inter- to intraspecific
   competition), suggesting that PSF could prevent competitive dominance
   and promote coexistence. When competition was measured against plants
   growing singly, the strength of competition overwhelmed PSF, indicating
   that the relative importance of PSF may depend not only on neighbour
   identity but also density. We evaluate how competition and PSFs might
   interact across resource gradients; PSF will likely strengthen
   competitive interactions in high resource environments and enhance
   facilitative interactions in low-resource environments. Finally, we
   provide a framework for filling key knowledge gaps and advancing our

   calcification but exacerbates effects on growth}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Because many of the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine
   life may result from underlying energetic short-falls associated with
   increased metabolic demands, several studies have hypothesized that
   negative responses to high CO2 could be reduced by energy input.
   Although this hypothesis was supported by a recent meta-analysis, we
   believe that the meta-analytic calculation used was not appropriate to
   test the stated hypothesis. Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put
   forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and
   CO2 interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining
   the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using
   factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive
   effect and CO2 has a negative effect on both growth and calcification.
   For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO2 impacts.
   Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated
   the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope
   upon which CO2 effects can act in food-replete situations. These
   interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic
   approach. Ongoing changes in food supply and carbonate chemistry,
   coupled with under-described, poorly understood, and potentially
   surprising interactive outcomes for these two variables, suggest that
   the role of food should remain a priority in ocean acidification

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{943-949}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Organisms engage in multiple species interactions
   simultaneously. While pollination studies generally focus on plants and
   pollinators exclusively, secondary robbing, a behavior that requires
   other species (primary robbers) to first create access holes in
   corollas, is common. It has been shown that secondary robbing can reduce
   plants' female fitness; however, we lack knowledge about its impact on
   male plant fitness.
   METHODS: We experimentally simulated primary and secondary robbing in
   the monocarpic perennial Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae),
   quantifying indirect effects on pollinator-mediated pollen (dye)
   donation. We also assessed whether continual nectar removal via the
   floral opening has similar effects on hummingbird-pollinator behavior as
   continual secondary robbing through robber holes.
   KEY RESULTS: We found no significant indirect effects of secondary
   robbing on a component of Ipomopsis male fitness. Although robbing did
   reduce pollen (dye) donation due to avoidance of robbed plants by
   pollinating hummingbirds, pollen donation did not differ between the two
   robbing treatments. The effects of secondary robbing on hummingbird
   behavior resembled effects of chronic nectar removal by pollinators. Our
   results indicate that hummingbird pollinators may use a combination of
   cues, including cues given by the presence or absence of nectar, to make
   foraging decisions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined with prior research, this study suggests that
   secondary robbing is less costly to a component of male fitness than to
   female fitness in Ipomopsis, broadening our knowledge of the overall
   costs of mutualism exploitation to total plant fitness.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Plant-soil feedback (PSF) has been identified as a key driver of local
   plant diversity and evenness in competitive communities. However, while
   it has been shown that spatial PSF heterogeneity can alter plant
   performance and competitive interactions, there is no proof of principle
   that spatial PSF heterogeneity enhances community diversity.
   Using a grassland model system, we separated two aspects of spatial
   heterogeneity: the number of species conditioning the soil and spatial
   distribution of the PSFs.
   Our data show that PSFs promoted a higher plant evenness when the soil
   was conditioned by multiple species (mixed-conditioned) than when the
   soil was conditioned by a single species (mono-conditioned). On
   mono-conditioned soils, heterospecifics typically outperformed the focal
   species. In addition, there was a trend for increasing community
   evenness from uniform, via fine-grained to coarse-grained
   mixed-conditioned soils, but this was not significant.
   On mixed-conditioned soils, performance of all competing species was
   intermediate to the best and the worst mono-conditioned soils, leading
   to higher community evenness.
   Our data demonstrate that PSFs play a role in promoting plant evenness.
   Across mono-conditioned soils, PSF led to altered competitive
   hierarchies. However, on soils conditioned by multiple species,
   competitive ability among species was more similar and this led to
   higher plant evenness. The spatial distribution of the heterogeneity, on
   the other hand, did not significantly affect plant evenness. Our data
   therefore show that community evenness was more strongly related to the
   number of plant species that conditioned the soil than the spatial
   distribution of the PSF heterogeneity. Future studies need to
   investigate the importance of PSFs in the field across plant life stages
   and multiple generations.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-112}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Reductions in community evenness can lead to local extinctions as
   dominant species exclude subordinate species; however, herbivores can
   prevent competitive exclusion by consuming otherwise dominant plant
   species, thus increasing evenness. While these predictions logically
   result from chronic, gradual reductions in evenness, rapid, temporary
   pulses of dominance may also reduce species richness. Short pulses of
   dominance can occur as biotic or abiotic conditions temporarily favour
   one or a few species, manifested as increased temporal variability (the
   inverse of temporal stability) in community evenness. Here, we tested
   whether consumers help maintain plant diversity by reducing the temporal
   variability in community evenness. We tested our hypothesis by reducing
   herbivore abundance in a detailed study of a developing, tallgrass
   prairie restoration. To assess the broader implications of the
   importance of herbivory on community evenness as well as potential
   mechanisms, we paired this study with a global herbivore reduction
   experiment. We found that herbivores maintained plant richness in a
   tallgrass prairie restoration by limiting temporary pulses in dominance
   by a single species. Dominance by an annual species in a single year was
   negatively associated with species richness, suggesting that short
   pulses of dominance may be sufficient to exclude subordinate species.
   The generality of this site-level relationship was supported by the
   global experiment in which inter-annual variability in evenness declined
   in the presence of vertebrate herbivores over timeframes ranging in
   length from 2 to 5years, preventing declines in species richness.
   Furthermore, inter-annual variability of community evenness was also
   negatively associated with pre-treatment species richness.Synthesis. A
   loss or reduction of herbivores can destabilize plant communities by
   allowing brief periods of dominance by one or a few species, potentially
   triggering a feedback cycle of dominance and extinction. Such cycles may
   not occur immediately following the loss of herbivores, being delayed
   until conditions allow temporary periods of dominance by a subset of
   plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Plants influence associated soil biotic communities that in turn can
   alter the performance of the subsequently growing plants. Although such
   plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are considered as important drivers of plant
   community assembly, past PSF studies have mainly addressed plant biomass
   production. However, plant performance is not only the production of
   biomass but comprises a sequence of different life stages: from seed
   germination over vegetative growth up to the production of a viable
   progeny. Here, we assessed the effects of soil biotic communities that
   were previously conditioned for 3years by a focal plant species
   monoculture or species mixtures on key plant life stages from
   germination and vegetative growth to flowering and the production of
   viable seeds. We used three common grassland herb species that were
   grown in a sterile substrate and inoculated with a sterile control soil
   or with living soils. Living soils were conditioned either by the focal
   species in monoculture or a four- or eight-species mixture that included
   the focal species to represent a decrease in the target plants'
   conspecific influence on the soil communities. We show that the effect
   of soil biota changed from positive at the plants' juvenile life stages
   to neutral or negative at the plants' adult life stages and ultimately
   decreased plant fitness. A higher conspecific influence on the soil
   communities pronounced the positive effects at the juvenile life stage
   but also the negative effects at adult life stages. Further, we observed
   direct soil biotic effects on flower production and plant fitness that

Abstract = {{Plants engage in complex multipartite interactions with mutualists and
   antagonists, but these interactions are rarely included in studies that
   explore plant invasiveness. When considered in isolation, we know that
   beneficial microbes can enhance an exotic plant's invasive ability and
   that herbivorous insects often decrease an exotic plant's likeliness of
   success. However, the effect of these partners on plant fitness has not
   been well characterized when all three species coevolve. We use
   computational evolutionary modeling of a trait-based system to test how
   microbes and herbivores simultaneously coevolving with an invading plant
   affect the invaders' probability of becoming established. Specifically,
   we designed a model that explores how a beneficial microbe would
   influence the outcome of an interaction between a plant and herbivore.
   To model novel interactions, we included a phenotypic trait shared by
   each species. Making this trait continuous and selectable allows us to
   explore how trait similarities between coevolving plants, herbivores and
   microbes affect fitness. Using this model, we answer the following
   questions: (1) Can a beneficial plant-microbe interaction influence the
   evolutionary outcome of antagonistic interactions between plants and
   herbivores? (2) How does the initial trait similarity between
   interacting organisms affect the likelihood of plant survival in novel
   locations? (3) Does the effect of tripartite interactions on the
   invasion success of a plant depend on whether organisms interact through
   trait similarity {[}Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)] or dissimilarity
   (Biotic Resistance Hypothesis)? We found that it was much more difficult
   for plants to invade under the ERH but that beneficial microbes increase
   the probability of plant survival in a novel range under both
   hypotheses. To our knowledge, this model is the first to use tripartite
   interactions to explore novel species introductions. It represents a
   step towards gaining a better understanding of the factors influencing
   establishment of exotic species to prevent future invasions.}},

Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1766-1774}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant community productivity commonly increases with increasing plant
   diversity, which is explained by complementarity among plant species in
   resource utilization (complementarity effect), or by selection of
   particularly productive plant species in diverse plant communities
   (selection effect). Recent studies have also shown that soil biota can
   drive the positive plant diversity-productivity relationship by
   suppressing productivity more in low- than in high-diversity plant
   communities. However, much remains unknown about whether soil fertility
   plays a role in determining how soil biota affect plant
   diversity-productivity relationships.
   2. We hypothesized that under high soil fertility conditions, negative
   soil biota effects dominate, which reduces plant monoculture biomass
   more than that of high-diversity plant communities. Conversely, under
   low soil fertility conditions, we hypothesized positive soil biota
   effects dominate, which facilitates plant resource partitioning and
   enhances community-level biomass in high-diversity plant communities.
   Hence, we expected positive plant diversity-community productivity
   relationships under low and high soil fertility conditions but caused by
   different mechanisms. 3. We tested these hypotheses using woody
   seedlings and set up plant assemblages with four species richness levels
   (one, two, four and eight species), and grew them in sterilized and
   unsterilized (sterilized soil + living soil inoculum) soils at two
   nutrient levels (low versus high fertility).
   4. We found that at high fertility negative soil biota effects dominated
   and suppressed plant community biomass more in high-diversity plant
   communities than in monocultures, resulting in reduced complementarity
   effects of diverse plant communities and a non-significant plant species
   richness-community biomass relationship in unsterilized soil. Whereas at
   low fertility soil biota had net neutral to positive effects on plant
   community biomass but the beneficial effects did not increase with
   increasing plant species richness. Instead, soil biota neutrally
   affected the positive plant species richness-community biomass
   relationship, presumably due to non-specific effects of beneficial soil
   biota.
   5. Synthesis. Soil biota and soil fertility interactively determine
   plant species richness-community biomass relationships. Moreover, soil
   biota modulate the complementary resource use among plant species. These
   findings suggest that environmental context plays an important role in
   determining whether and how soil biota generate the
   biodiversity-productivity relationship. Future studies would benefit
   from revealing the mechanisms underlying the interactive effects of soil
   biota, soil fertility, and plant diversity on ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{The sum of fruit and seed predation by multiple species may strongly

   combined effects of ungulates, seed-eating rodents and insect
   pre-dispersal seed predators on the reproductive success of the
   Mediterranean gum cistus shrub (Cistus ladanifer), over two consecutive
   years within a long-term ungulate-exclusion experiment. We compared
   fruiting success in shrubs exposed and protected from ungulates by
   examining fruit abortion and fruit production. We also investigated the
   effect of insect predation on seed production (i.e. proportion of
   depredated fruit and seed loss) and measured fruit weight, seed number
   per fruit, and seed weight of unpredated fruits. Ungulate browsing
   directly removed 42.3\% of the plant reproductive structures, early in
   the reproductive season and insect predation reduced mature seeds by
   over 40\%. Results also emphasize the additive effects of ungulate
   browsing on pre-dispersal insect predation and fruit abortion which
   increased by 74.7\% and 60.9\%, respectively. Rodents, which only
   occurred in ungulate-excluded plots, had a limited and later effect on
   seed production with 6\% of mature fruit loss. Fruit weight, seed weight
   and number were higher in shrubs protected from ungulates. Our study
   indicated that seed predation by mice was irrelevant, but ungulate and
   invertebrate seed predation interacted to strongly limit the

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{738-749}},

Abstract = {{1. Extensive empirical work has demonstrated local adaptation to
   discrete environments, yet few studies have elucidated the genetic and
   environment mechanisms that generate it. Here, we advocate for research
   that broadens our understanding of local adaptation beyond pattern and
   towards process. We discuss how studies of local adaptation can be
   designed to address two unresolved questions in evolutionary ecology:
   Does local adaptation result from fitness trade-offs at individual loci
   across habitats? How do agents of selection interact to generate local
   adaptation to discrete contrasting habitats types and continuous
   environmental gradients?
   2. To inform future investigations of the genetic basis of local
   adaptation, we conducted a literature review of studies that mapped
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness in native field environments
   using reciprocal transplant experiments with hybrid mapping populations
   or Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) panels. We then reviewed the
   literature for field experiments that disentangle the contributions of
   various agents of selection to local adaptation. For each question, we
   suggest future lines of inquiry and discuss implications for climate
   change and agriculture research.
   3. (i) Studies in the native habitats of five biological systems
   revealed that local adaptation is more often caused by conditional
   neutrality than genetic trade-offs at the level of the QTL. We consider
   the ramifications of this result and discuss knowledge gaps in our
   current understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation. (ii) We
   uncovered only five studies that identified the agents of selection that
   contribute to local adaptation, and nearly all were conducted in
   discrete habitats rather than across the continuous environmental
   gradients that many species inhabit. We introduce a novel experimental
   framework for illuminating the processes underlying local adaptation.
   4. A holistic view of local adaptation is critical for predicting the
   responses of organisms to climate change, enhancing conservation
   efforts, and developing strategies to improve crop resilience to
   environmental stress. Experiments that manipulate agents of selection in
   native field environments using pedigreed populations or GWAS panels
   offer unique opportunities for detecting the genetic and environmental
   mechanisms that generate local adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that plant performance can be influenced by the

   has examined the effect of such phylogenetic density dependence on the
   transition from seed to seedling. Using 6 years of data on seedling
   recruitment and seed rain of 13 species from 130 stations (one 0.5 m(2)
   seed trap and three adjacent 1 m(2) seedling plots) in a subtropical
   evergreen forest, we asked: (1) Does negative density dependence act
   across seed to seedling stages? (2) Is there evidence for phylogenetic
   density dependence during the seed to seedling transition? (3) Does the
   strength of density dependence vary among years? Generalized linear
   mixed-effects models were used to model seed to seedling transition as a
   function of conspecific seed and seedling densities, heterospecific seed
   and seedling densities, and mean phylogenetic distance of heterospecific
   seeds and seedling. Conspecific seed density had a significant negative
   effect on seedling transition rates for 12 of 13 focal species. In
   contrast, conspecific seedling density had a positive effect for 7
   species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences. Few species
   were significantly affected by the density or phylogenetic relatedness
   of heterospecific seeds and seedlings. Only conspecific seed density
   effects varied among years for most focal species. Overall, our results
   reveal that conspecific seed and seedling densities play a more
   important role than the density or relatedness of heterospecific seeds
   and seedlings during the seed to seedling stage, suggesting that
   species-specific seed predators, along with habitat preferences, may
   contribute to diversity maintenance in this forest.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species generate specific soil communities that feedback on plant

   wild progenitor Lactuca serriola to test the hypotheses that separate
   Lactuca species generate unique soil communities and that these soil
   communities differentially influence host, and neighboring, plant growth
   and competition. We grew each Lactuca in competition with the other, in
   sterile and non-sterile soils. We then examined the growth of each
   Lactuca species in sterile, non-sterile, and preconditioned soil.
   Finally, we used TRFLP techniques to explore whether the two Lactuca
   species generate significantly different bacterial communities in their
   rhizosphere soils. L. sativa proved to be the stronger competitor of the
   two species. However, sterilization increased the competitive effect of
   L. serriola background competitors. The growth experiment showed a
   significant effect on plant species, soil treatment, and the interaction
   of the two. Preconditioning soil caused reduced growth in both Lactuca
   species. Only L. serriola showed significantly increased growth in
   sterile soils. Our TRFLP analysis showed that the L. sativa soil
   community was significantly less diverse and that soil preconditioning
   had the largest impact on the community composition. These results show
   that Lactuca serriola's rhizosphere communities generate a stronger
   negative feedback for plant growth than do the communities associated
   with L. sativa. Our study suggests that selection for plants that are
   able to grow in dense monoculture may have released Lactuca from
   species-specific negative soil feedbacks. This has important
   implications for both agriculture and the evolution of invasive plant

Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, an increasing number of studies have
   quantified the effects of herbivory on plant populations using
   stage-structured population models and integral projection models,
   allowing for the calculation of plant population growth rates (lambda)
   with and without herbivory. In this paper, I assembled 29 studies and
   conducted a meta-regression to determine the importance of invertebrate
   herbivores to population growth rates (lambda) while accounting for
   missing data. I found that invertebrate herbivory often induced
   important reductions in plant population growth rates (with herbivory,
   lambda was 1.08 +/- 0.36; without herbivory, lambda was 1.28 +/- 0.58).
   This relationship tended to be weaker for seed predation than for other
   types of herbivory, except when seed predation rates were very high.
   Even so, the amount by which studies reduced herbivory was a poor
   predictor of differences in population growth rates-which strongly
   cautions against using measured herbivory rates as a proxy for the
   impact of herbivores. Herbivory reduced plant population growth rates
   significantly more when potential growth rates were high, which helps to
   explain why there was less variation in actual population growth rates
   than in potential population growth rates. The synthesis of these
   studies also shows the need for future studies to report variance in

Abstract = {{The plant-soil feedback (PSF) framework has become an important theory
   in plant ecology, yet many ecological and evolutionary factors that
   influence PSFs have yet to be fully considered. Here, we discuss the
   importance of local adaptation among plants and root-associated fungi
   and bacteria. Furthermore, we show how inclusion of the optimal resource
   allocation (OA) model can help predict the direction and outcome of PSFs
   under environmental change. Plants and associated soil microbes have
   co-evolved for millennia, generating adaptations to each other and to
   their local environment. This local co-adaptation is likely generated by
   a suite of multidirectional exchanges of goods and services among
   plants, fungi and bacteria, and the constant changes in
   above-ground-below-ground interactions. Resource limitation may be a
   driver of local adaptation among organisms involved in nutritional
   symbioses. The OA model states that when an essential resource is
   limited, natural selection will favour taxa that forage optimally by
   adjusting their biomass and energy allocation such that productivity is
   equally limited by all resources. Co-adaptation will therefore respond
   to the local limiting resource conditions through taxa-specific resource
   transfer interactions. The OA model can help predict the outcomes of
   PSFs across a range of resource gradients and environmental changes such
   as increasing drought or atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Positive
   feedback is predicted in systems where resource exchange among plants
   and associated soil microbes can ameliorate resource limitation, or in
   systems where microbes provide another important service such as
   pathogen defence. Feedback strength is expected to diminish as resources
   become less limiting. Negative feedback is predicted when resources are
   in luxury supply and populations of opportunistic plant pathogens
   increase relative to commensal or mutualist microbes. Future,
   field-based studies that integrate naturally co-occurring systems of
   plants, microbes and their local soil are needed to further test the
   hypothesis that resource availability is an effective predictor of the
   direction and magnitude of PSFs. A more mechanistic understanding of
   PSFs will help land managers and farmers to manipulate plant-microbial
   soil interactions to respond to environmental change and to effectively
   harness beneficial symbioses for plant nutrition and pathogen control.}},

   how they enable plants to maintain their reproductive output when facing
   community-level herbivory under natural conditions, however, remains
   unknown. We demonstrate that jasmonate-deficient Nicotiana attenuata
   plants suffer more damage by arthropod and vertebrate herbivores than
   jasmonate-producing plants in nature. However, only damage by vertebrate
   herbivores translates into a significant reduction in flower production.
   Vertebrate stem peeling has the strongest negative impact on plant
   flower production. Stems are defended by jasmonate-dependent nicotine,
   and the native cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus nuttallii avoids
   jasmonate-producing N. attenuata shoots because of their high levels of
   nicotine. Thus, endogenous jasmonates enable plants to resist different
   types of herbivores in nature, and jasmonate-dependent defenses are
   important for plants to maintain their reproductive potential when
   facing vertebrate herbivory. Ecological and evolutionary models on plant
   defense signaling should aim at integrating arthropod and vertebrate
   herbivory at the community level.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between plants and soil microorganisms influence individual
   plant performance and thus plant-community composition. Most studies on
   such plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have been performed under controlled
   greenhouse conditions, whereas no study has directly compared PSFs under
   greenhouse and natural field conditions. We grew three grass species
   that differ in local abundance in grassland communities simultaneously
   in the greenhouse and field on field-collected soils either previously
   conditioned by these species or by the general grassland community. As
   soils in grasslands are typically conditioned by mixes of species
   through the patchy and heterogeneous plant species' distributions, we
   additionally compared the effects of species-specific versus
   non-specific species conditioning on PSFs in natural and greenhouse
   conditions. In almost all comparisons PSFs differed between the
   greenhouse and field. In the greenhouse, plant growth in
   species-specific and non-specific soils resulted in similar effects with
   neutral PSFs for the most abundant species and positive PSFs for the
   less abundant species. In contrast, in the field all grass species
   tested performed best in non-specific plots, whereas species-specific
   PSFs were neutral for the most abundant and varied for the less abundant
   species. This indicates a general beneficial effect of plant diversity
   on PSFs in the field. Controlled greenhouse conditions might provide
   valuable insights on the nominal effects of soils on plants. However,
   the PSFs observed in greenhouse conditions may not be the determining
   drivers in natural plant communities where their effects may be
   overwhelmed by the diversity of abiotic and biotic above- and
   belowground interactions in the field.}},

Volume = {{97}},

Pages = {{918-928}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Plant-plant and plant-soil interactions can help maintain plant
   diversity and ecosystem functions. Changes in these interactions may
   underlie experimentally observed increases in biodiversity effects over
   time via the selection of genotypes adapted to low or high plant
   diversity. Little is known, however, about such community-history
   effects and particularly the role of plant-soil interactions in this
   process. Soil-legacy effects may occur if co-evolved interactions with
   soil communities either positively or negatively modify plant
   biodiversity effects. We tested how plant selection and soil legacy
   influence biodiversity effects on productivity, and whether such effects
   increase the resistance of the communities to invasion by weeds. We used
   two plant selection treatments: parental plants growing in monoculture
   or in mixture over 8 yr in a grassland biodiversity experiment in the
   field, which we term monoculture types and mixture types. The two
   soil-legacy treatments used in this study were neutral soil inoculated
   with live or sterilized soil inocula collected from the same plots in
   the biodiversity experiment. For each of the four factorial
   combinations, seedlings of eight species were grown in monocultures or
   four-species mixtures in pots in an experimental garden over 15 weeks.
   Soil legacy (live inoculum) strongly increased biodiversity
   complementarity effects for communities of mixture types, and to a
   significantly weaker extent for communities of monoculture types. This
   may be attributed to negative plant-soil feedbacks suffered by mixture
   types in monocultures, whereas monoculture types had positive plant-soil
   feedbacks, in both monocultures and mixtures. Monocultures of mixture
   types were most strongly invaded by weeds, presumably due to increased
   pathogen susceptibility, reduced biomass, and altered plant-soil
   interactions of mixture types. These results show that biodiversity
   effects in experimental grassland communities can be modified by the
   evolution of positive vs. negative plant-soil feedbacks of plant
   monoculture vs. mixture types.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Loss in seed yield and therefore decrease in plant fitness due to
   simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores is not necessarily additive,
   as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, it is
   not clear how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different
   conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed
   yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation
   although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause
   substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to
   compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the
   interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking
   different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In
   15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed
   and stem weevils, pollen beetles, and pod midges. Pest pressure varied
   drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing
   us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple
   species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had,
   as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the
   strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed
   yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and stem weevils
   was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to
   insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several
   pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species.
   Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management
   decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically
   suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of

Abstract = {{Herbivory can negatively affect several components of plant
   reproduction. Yet, because of a lack of experimental studies involving
   multiple populations, the extent to which differences in herbivory
   contribute to among-population variation in plant reproductive success
   is poorly known. We experimentally determined the effects of insect
   herbivory on reproductive output in nine natural populations of the
   perennial herb Lythrum salicaria along a disturbance gradient in an
   archipelago in northern Sweden, and we quantified among-population
   differentiation in resistance to herbivory in a common-garden experiment
   in the same area. The intensity of leaf herbivory varied > 500-fold and
   mean female reproductive success > 400-fold among the study populations.
   The intensity of herbivory was lowest in populations subject to strong
   disturbance from ice and wave action. Experimental removal of insect
   herbivores showed that the effect of herbivory on female reproductive
   success was correlated with the intensity of herbivory and that
   differences in insect herbivory could explain much of the
   among-population variation in the proportion of plants flowering and
   seed production. Population differentiation in resistance to herbivory
   was limited. The results demonstrate that the intensity of herbivory is
   a major determinant of flowering and seed output in L. salicaria, but
   that differences in herbivory are not associated with differences in
   plant resistance at the spatial scale examined. They further suggest
   that the physical disturbance regime may strongly influence the
   performance and abundance of perennial herbs and patterns of selection
   not only because of its effect on interspecific competition, but also
   because of effects on interactions with specialized herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Many plants produce defense chemicals that are induced in response to
   damage. In spite of the tight links between floral tissue and plant
   reproduction, very little is known about whether floral defenses are
   induced in response to floral damage. We manipulated Impatiens capensis
   flowers to determine whether floral damage reduces subsequent florivory,
   whether it induces anthocyanins or condensed tannins in floral tissues,
   and whether responses are localized or systemic. We damaged one flower
   per plant at one of three damage levels (0, 30, or 60 \% tissue
   removal), collected subsequent flowers at set time intervals and branch
   locations, and measured whole-plant florivory for 3 weeks following
   damage. We also observed a flower color polymorphism and analyzed
   responses separately for red- and yellow-flowered plants. Moderate
   damage to a single flower reduced subsequent whole-plant florivory, but
   heavy damage did not. Moderate damage to a focal flower also increased
   anthocyanins in subsequent flowers on the same branch of red-flowered
   plants, but decreased anthocyanins on parallel-branch flowers of
   yellow-flowered plants. Damage did not affect floral tannins. Because
   the reduction in florivory was systemic and induced anthocyanins were
   not consistently induced systemically, there may be other secondary
   compounds not measured in this study that were systemically induced, or
   effects of visual or olfactory cues of damage itself that reduced
   subsequent florivory. This is the first study demonstrating that damage
   to a single flower can reduce subsequent whole-plant florivory in the

Title = {{A Latex Metabolite Benefits Plant Fitness under Root Herbivore Attack}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plants produce large amounts of secondary metabolites in their shoots
   and roots and store them in specialized secretory structures. Although
   secondary metabolites and their secretory structures are commonly
   assumed to have a defensive function, evidence that they benefit plant
   fitness under herbivore attack is scarce, especially below ground. Here,
   we tested whether latex secondary metabolites produced by the common
   dandelion (Taraxacum officinale agg.) decrease the performance of its
   major native insect root herbivore, the larvae of the common cockchafer
   (Melolontha melolontha), and benefit plant vegetative and reproductive
   fitness under M. melolontha attack. Across 17 T. officinale genotypes
   screened by gas and liquid chromatography, latex concentrations of the
   sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G)
   were negatively associated with M. melolontha larval growth. Adding
   purified TA-G to artificial diet at ecologically relevant concentrations
   reduced larval feeding. Silencing the germacrene A synthase ToGAS1, an
   enzyme that was identified to catalyze the first committed step of TA-G
   biosynthesis, resulted in a 90\% reduction of TA-G levels and a
   pronounced increase in M. melolontha feeding. Transgenic, TA-G-deficient
   lines were preferred by M. melolontha and suffered three times more root
   biomass reduction than control lines. In a common garden experiment
   involving over 2,000 T. officinale individuals belonging to 17 different
   genotypes, high TA-G concentrations were associated with the maintenance
   of high vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack.
   Taken together, our study demonstrates that a latex secondary metabolite
   benefits plants under herbivore attack, a result that provides a
   mechanistic framework for root herbivore driven natural selection and
   evolution of plant defenses below ground.}},

Abstract = {{Non-native invasive plants can associate with and accumulate microbes in
   their introduced range, which may transfer to native plants and
   potentially exert pathogenic effects. In these cases, the invasive plant
   can act as a pathogen reservoir. However, little is known about this as
   a possible plant invasion mechanism. We isolated fungi from the roots of
   32 Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae) plants collected across Ontario,
   Canada, where it is highly invasive. The growth effects of known
   pathogenic fungi were tested on V. rossicum and two commonly
   co-occurring native plants, Asclepias syriaca (Apocynaceae) and Solidago
   canadensis (Asteraceae). We hypothesised that these fungi would reduce
   the growth of native plants more than that of V. rossicum. Of the18
   fungal taxa isolated from V. rossicum roots, 15 were previously reported
   as pathogens on other plants and 16 represent new records on this plant.
   Four of the seven fungi tested on V. rossicum increased its total
   biomass and/or root-shoot ratio compared to uninoculated controls. When
   inoculated individually, three of these fungi had neutral growth effects
   on the native plants. However, when inoculated together, Cadophora sp.,
   Ilyonectria radicicola, and Macrophomina phaseolina reduced the total
   biomass of S. canadensis. These results support that at least in some
   cases non-native invaders may benefit from associating with soil
   microbes that can function as pathogens on native plants. These
   differential functional outcomes between non-native invasive and native
   plants may be important for mediating plant community structure and the

   Oviposition decisions of the dipteran pre-dispersal seed predator,

   preferentially oviposit on hermaphrodite plants and, if so, are
   oviposition choices correlated with flower size? Is larval survivorship
   higher on hermaphrodite plants and, if so, is larval success correlated
   with flower size? Can the differences in oviposition and/or larval

   Larval survival was 30\% greater on hermaphrodites than females and
   higher on plants with larger sepals. However, the difference in sepal

   Egg numbers declined over weeks, but differences in egg loads between

Abstract = {{Pathogens can accumulate on invasive plants over time, which could lead

   plant-soil feedback study and 454 pyrosequencing to investigate pathogen
   accumulation over 100years on a highly invasive plant in eastern North
   America that shows localized declines, Vincetoxicum rossicum

   four invasion periods of V.rossicum across Ontario, Canada (old,
   c.100years; intermediate, 50-60years; young, < 12years; and uninvaded),
   and grew V.rossicum in these soils in a glasshouse study. Our hypothesis

   experience less positive feedbacks compared to those grown in more
   recently invaded or uninvaded soils. We collected roots of V.rossicum
   from the invasion periods and performed 454 pyrosequencing targeting
   fungi. We hypothesized that the abundance and richness of fungi that are
   known plant pathogens would be higher in roots from older invasions
   compared to more recent invasions. Contrasting with our hypothesis,
   V.rossicum experienced overall growth promotion due to soil biota,
   regardless of invasion period. Vincetoxicum rossicum roots were
   colonized by a large number of fungal taxa, including many known plant
   pathogens or mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, we found
   no evidence of pathogen accumulation in older invaded sites in terms of
   species composition, richness or abundance.Synthesis. Our consistent
   results in the glasshouse and the field highlight the strength of
   combining high-throughput sequencing data with plant-soil feedback
   experiments. We showed that the roots of Vincetoxicum rossicum
   (Apocynaceae) were colonized by many fungal taxa, but found no evidence
   for changes in plant growth or accumulation of fungal pathogens with
   longer invasion time. High pathogen loads may not lead to concurrent
   declines in invasive plants. Plant invasions, as demonstrated by
   V.rossicum, may be unpredictable in their ability to accumulate
   pathogens capable of leading to population declines.}},

Abstract = {{Revegetation of the tailings dumps produced by various industrial
   activities is necessary to prevent dust storms and erosion and
   represents a great challenge for ecological restoration. Little is known
   about the microbial colonisation and community structure of revegetated
   tailings following site exploitation. Here, we report the sequencing of
   16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fungal RNA gene amplicons
   from chlor-alkali residue and from an adjacent undisturbed soil to
   define the composition and assembly of the rhizosphere microbial
   communities. After quality filtering, a total of 72,373 and 89,929
   bacterial sequences and 122,618 and 111,209 fungal sequences remained
   for community analysis from undisturbed soil and tailings dump samples,
   respectively. These reads were affiliated with 45 bacterial and 9 fungal
   phyla and 113 bacterial and 35 fungal classes. We observed a clear
   dominance of Gammaproteobacteria at our study site (24\% of total
   sequences), especially of the Pseudomonas genera (72\% of
   Gammaproteobacteria sequences), together with the dominance of a few
   fungal taxa, such as Hebeloma and Geopora. However, we also noticed that
   the core microbiome comprised 64.4\% and 62.4\% of the bacterial and
   fungal genera, respectively, despite marked differences in soil
   physico-chemical properties. A heatmap of correlations between soil
   parameters and taxa confirmed that approximately 50\% of the 33 dominant
   taxa colonised both types of soil. We further demonstrated that the
   global bacterial-fungal network topology of the dump approximated that
   of the undisturbed soil. Our approach illuminates the importance of
   studying more than just a single component of the microbial community
   and represents a step forward in uncovering the microbial ecology of
   disturbed environments beyond what is generally found in conventional
   studies. Our study also provides novel global community proxies that
   have led us to conclude that environmental filtering is more likely to
   occur through the activity of tree roots rather than as a result of
   specific soil characteristics and could be an important force in the
   assembly of at least some microbial communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The impact of mutualists on a partner's demography depends on how they
   affect the partner's multiple vital rates and how those vital rates, in
   turn, affect population growth. However, mutualism studies rarely
   measure effects on multiple vital rates or integrate them to assess the
   ultimate impact on population growth. We used vital rate data,
   population models and simulations of long-term population dynamics to
   quantify the demographic impact of a guild of ant species on the plant
   Ferocactus wislizeni. The ants feed at the plant's extrafloral nectaries
   and attack herbivores attempting to consume reproductive organs.
   Ant-guarded plants produced significantly more fruit, but ants had no
   significant effect on individual growth or survival. After integrating
   ant effects across these vital rates, we found that projected population
   growth was not significantly different between unguarded and ant-guarded
   plants because population growth was only weakly influenced by
   differences in fruit production (though strongly influenced by
   differences in individual growth and survival). However, simulations
   showed that ants could positively affect long-term plant population
   dynamics through services provided during rare but important events
   (herbivore outbreaks that reduce survival or years of high seedling
   recruitment associated with abundant precipitation). Thus, in this
   seemingly clear example of mutualism, the interaction may actually yield
   no clear benefit to plant population growth, or if it does, may only do
   so through the actions of the ants during rare events. These insights
   demonstrate the value of taking a demographic approach to studying the
   consequences of mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{This study showed the negative effects of insect defoliation on the
   reproduction of canopy trees, where defoliation was not artificially
   manipulated but rather observed in a natural setting.
   The gypsy moth (Lymantria diapar) is a serious defoliator with the
   ability to completely defoliate forest canopies. Although the negative
   effects of defoliation on tree reproduction have been revealed in
   studies with artificially manipulated defoliation, few studies have
   examined the effect of insect defoliation on the reproduction of canopy
   trees under natural condition. In this study, visual surveys were used
   to clarify the effect of gypsy moth defoliation on the production of
   acorns by oaks (Quercus spp.). Surveys were conducted in an outbreak
   year at 22 sites in central Japan (13 sites with Quercus crispula and
   nine sites with Q. serrata). Five of the Q. crispula sites were severely
   defoliated (mean defoliation ranged from 67 to 88 \%), while the
   remainder of the Q. crispula sites and all of the Q. serrata sites were
   lightly defoliated (0-20 \%). A negative effect of gypsy moth
   defoliation on acorn production was detected for Q. crispula. However,
   there was a synchronous decrease in acorn production from the previous
   year and crop levels were low at all sites regardless of the defoliation
   severity. The consistent low crop levels were likely the result of
   weather-related factors. Defoliation also negatively affected the
   production of acorns for Q. serrata; however, severe defoliation was not
   present at any Q. serrata sites. This study suggests that insect
   defoliation can affect forest ecosystem processes, such as the
   regeneration of host trees and the behavior of wildlife that depend on
   seed production, by reducing the reproductive potential of host trees.}},

Abstract = {{Inoculation may influence mycorrhizal colonization and provide benefits
   to plants in restoration projects. However, it is unclear whether
   inoculation has consistent effects across ecosystem types, if it has
   long-term effects on colonization, and whether sources of inocula differ
   in their effectiveness. To address these issues, we performed a
   meta-analysis of published restoration studies across a variety of
   ecosystems to examine the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on
   mycorrhizal establishment and plant growth under field conditions.
   Although we included trials from a variety of geographic locations,
   disturbance types, and ecosystem types, the majority were based in
   temperate ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere, and fewer trials were
   from tropical ecosystems. Across ecosystem types, we found that
   inoculation consistently increased the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in
   degraded ecosystems, and thus improved the establishment of plants.
   These benefits did not significantly attenuate over time. Moreover,
   inocula from different sources varied in their effects on mycorrhizal
   colonization. Inocula sourced from reference ecosystems and inocula with
   specific fungal species yielded higher increases in mycorrhizal
   colonization than did inocula from commercial sources. These results
   suggest that inocula source matters, and that an initial investment into
   mycorrhizal inoculation could provide lasting benefits for facilitating
   the establishment of the below-and aboveground components of restored
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between plant and soil communities are known to play an
   integral role in shaping ecosystems. Plants influence the composition of
   soil communities and soil communities in turn influence plant
   performance. Such a plant-soil feedback may incur selection pressure on
   plants and the associating soil community. However, the evolutionary
   consequences of these above-belowground feedback interactions remain
   largely speculative. Here we assess whether plant-soil feedback effects
   differ between intraspecific plant populations and between generations
   within the same plant population. We used two populations of Trifolium
   pratense and assessed their performance when grown in association with
   their home versus away soil biota. Both populations were colonized by
   distinct microbial communities and performed better with their own home
   soil communities than with the soil community from the other
   intraspecific population, demonstrating intraspecific positive feedback
   effects of home soil. In one of the two populations, we found that plant
   performance and the root associated microbiota community differed
   between parental and progeny plants when inoculated with their own home
   soil. Differences in root associated community characteristics could
   explain more than 80\% of the variation in performance among the progeny
   and parental plants. Our results highlight that intraspecific
   differences in both plant and associated soil communities shape
   plant-soil feedback effects, and consequently indicate that plant-soil

Abstract = {{Nutrient limitation is a basic ecological constraint that has received
   little attention in studies on virus production and disease dynamics.
   Nutrient availability could directly limit the production of viral
   nucleic acids and proteins, or alternatively limit host growth and thus
   indirectly limit metabolic pathways necessary for viral replication. In
   order to compare direct and indirect effects of nutrient limitation on
   virus production within hosts, we manipulated soil nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) availability in a glasshouse for the wild grass host
   Bromus hordeaceus and the viral pathogen Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV.
   We found that soil N additions increased viral concentrations within
   host tissues, and the effect was mediated by host growth. Specifically,
   in statistical models evaluating the roles of host biomass production,
   leaf N and leaf P, viral production depended most strongly on host
   biomass, rather than the concentration of either nutrient. Furthermore,
   at low soil N, larger plants supported greater viral concentrations than
   smaller ones, whereas at high N, smaller plants supported greater viral
   concentrations. Our results suggest that enhanced viral productivity

Abstract = {{Aim High species richness at small spatial scales can increase

   selection effects. Recent evidence also suggests that soil biota can
   drive the increase in productivity caused by high species richness.
   Here, we take this a step farther and investigate whether soil biota can

   Location Missoula, Montana, USA.
   Methods Ten native grassland species were used to create plant
   assemblages with either one species (monocultures) or 10 species
   (polycultures) in a common garden. Soils cultured by these assemblages
   were collected and either sterilized or not to examine the combined
   effects of species richness and soil biota on the growth and competitive
   ability of the 10 native species against the invader Bromus tectorum.
   Results Live soil from monocultures inhibited the growth of all native
   species as a group and native grasses as a functional group more than
   live soil from polycultures. Sterilization eliminated the negative
   effects of soil from monocultures but not from polycultures. Native
   species also competed with B. tectorum more successfully in live soil
   from polycultures than live soil from monocultures, and sterilization
   eliminated the competitive advantage of natives in live polyculture
   soil.
   Main conclusions We found that local plant species richness can affect
   soil biota in ways that can increase the competitive effects of natives
   against an aggressive exotic invader; thus, our results suggest a
   mechanism by which species diversity might provide resistance to exotic
   invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Soil fauna is essential for ecosystem dynamics as it is involved in
   biogeochemical processes, promotes nutrient availability, and affects
   the animal communities associated with plants. In this study, we examine
   the possible relationship between the soil micro-arthropod community on
   foliage production and quality of the shrub Pittocaulon praecox. We also
   examine the arthropods associated to its foliage, particularly the size
   of the main herbivores and of their natural enemies, at two sites with
   contrasting vegetation cover and productivity. The diversity of soil
   microarthropods was assessed from soil samples collected monthly under
   P. praecox individuals over 13 mo. Specimens collected were identified
   to species or morphospecies. Shrub foliage productivity was evaluated
   through the amount of litter produced. Resource quality was assessed by
   the mean content (percentage by weight) of N, C, S, and P of 30 leaves
   from each shrub. The mean size of herbivores and their natural enemies
   were determined by measuring 20 adult specimens of each of the most
   abundant species. We found a higher species richness of soil
   microarthropods and foliar arthropods in the open site, although the
   diversity of foliage arthropods was lower in the closed site. Shrubs
   growing in the closed site tend to produce more, larger, and
   nutritionally poorer (lower nitrogen content) leaves than open site.
   Herbivores and their natural enemies were also larger in the closed
   site. We found a significant positive relationship between the diversity
   and species richness of foliar arthropods and the nitrogen content of
   leaves. In general, species richness and diversity of both the foliar
   and soil fauna, as well as the size of organisms belonging to higher
   trophic levels, were affected by vegetation cover and primary
   productivity at each site. These findings highlight the need to
   simultaneously consider at least four trophic levels (soil organisms,
   plants, herbivores, and natural enemies) to better understand the
   functioning of these systems and their responses to environmental

Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Herbivory can affect a plant's fi tness in a
   variety of ways, including modifying the biotic interactions of the
   plant. In particular, when herbivory infl uences fl oral display, we
   hypothesize that pollinator visitation will be altered accordingly. Here
   we studied the indirect effects of feeding by two beetles,
   Neogalerucella calmariensis and N. pusilla, released as a biological
   control, on plant-pollinator interactions and fi tness in the invasive
   plant, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria).
   Methods: Two herbivory treatments (ambient and simulated) were applied
   to plants in a naturally occurring population of purple loosestrife.
   During fl owering, traits of plants in the treatment and control groups
   were recorded. Data on pollinator visitation behavior was then collected
   after intense larval herbivory had ended.
   Key results: Plants exposed to herbivory treatments produced more fl
   owers and infl orescences but fl owered signifi cantly later than those
   in the control group. Moreover, we found a signifi cant, positive
   association of herbivory with the number of fl owers probed by
   bumblebees and with the number of times a foraging pollinator moved
   among infl orescences on a single plant. No differences in female fi
   tness (fruit or seed production) were detected.
   Conclusions: We conclude that herbivore-mediated differences in fl oral
   display traits impacted pollinator visitation behavior. However, as we
   discuss, differences in pollinator visitation did not translate into
   detectable differences in female reproductive success. We postulate that
   herbivory could infl uence other unmeasured aspects of fi tness, such as
   seed quality or the number of seeds sired.}},

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{Most flowering plants are hermaphrodites. However, in gynodioecious
   species, some members of the population are male-sterile and reproduce
   only by setting seed, while others gain fitness through both male and
   female function. How females compensate for the loss of male function
   remains unresolved for most gynodioecious species. Here, as with many
   plants, fitness differences may be influenced by interactions with
   multiple species. However, whether multiple species interactions result
   in gender-specific fitness differences remains unknown. Using
   observational data from 2009-2010, we quantified seed set of the two sex
   morphs of Polemonium foliosissimum and asked how it is affected by
   pollination, and seed predation from a dipteran predispersal seed
   predator (Anthomyiidae: Hylemya sp.). We assessed seed production and
   losses to predation in 27 populations for one year and in six
   populations for a second year. Females set significantly more seed than
   did hermaphrodites in both years. Of the fitness components we assessed,
   including the number of flowers per plant, fruit set, seeds/fruit, and
   proportion of fruits destroyed by Hylemya, only fruit destruction
   differed significantly between the sexes. In one year, seeds/fruit and
   predation had a stronger effect on seed set for hermaphrodites than for
   females. Because predispersal seed predators do not pollinate flowers,
   their effects may depend on successful pollination of flowers on which
   they oviposit. To examine if genders differed in pollen limitation and
   seed predation and/or their interactive effects, in 2011 we
   hand-pollinated flowers and removed seed predator eggs in a fully
   factorial design. Both sexes were pollen limited, but their degree of
   pollen limitation did not differ. However, predation reduced seed set
   more for hermaphrodites than for females. We found no significant
   interaction between hand pollen and seed predation, and no interaction
   between hand pollination and gender. Our results suggest that while
   interactions with both pollinators and seed predators affect
   reproductive success, floral enemies can cause inequality in seed set
   between genders. The next step is to understand how the seed set
   advantage affects long-term fitness and persistence of females in
   gynodioecious populations.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim was to explore the way that root system type affects mycorrhizal
   growth response of plants.
   An extensive meta-analysis with 943 peer-review publications was
   conducted to test the difference in mycorrhizal responses between
   taproot plants and plants with a fibrous root system.
   We found that taproot plants showed greater growth response (biomass, P
   and N uptake) to colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) than
   do plant species with fibrous root systems. This response pattern was
   dependent on stress types, AMF identity and species richness, and
   particularly the type of stress (abiotic vs. biotic). Taproot plants
   respond more to AMF than plants with a fibrous root system; but no
   difference was shown under biotic stress. The interaction effect seen
   for AMF and biotic stress was significantly higher for plants with
   fibrous root system, but was not significant between taproot plants and
   abiotic stress. Difference in biomass response was only found for
   Glomeraceae and Gigasporaceae between the two types of plants, while
   difference was found in P uptake response for Glomeraceae and
   Claroideoglomeraceae. However, plants with fibrous root system showed
   higher growth response than taproot plants under nematode stress.
   Taproot plants might be more dependent on mycorrhiza than plants with
   fibrous root system. This indicates that environmental conditions can
   modify the relative abundance of taproot plants and plants with fibrous
   root system through mycorrhizal functioning, which will regulate plant
   community dynamics and processes.}},

Abstract = {{Since its introduction from Europe, balsam woolly adelgid {[}Adelges
   piceae (Ratzeburg) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae)], a phloem-sap feeder, has
   spread throughout the balsam fir {[}Abies balsamea L. (MM.)] forests of
   eastern Canada. Trees under. A. piceae attack develop ``gout{''} and
   differ from unattacked trees in physiology, morphology, growth, and
   chemistry. The native and eruptive eastern spruce budworm
   {[}Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)] also
   attacks fir, causing severe defoliation during outbreaks. While balsam
   woolly adelgid and budworm feed at different times and on different host
   tissues, such spatiotemporally separated herbivores may still interact
   via host-mediated indirect effects. We examined the relationship between
   gout and the performance of developing budworm larvae in balsam fir
   dominated stands in western Newfoundland. We tested for adelgid-budworm
   interactions in unthinned and precommercially-thinned (similar to 20
   years past) stands, because the host's growing condition can affect
   foliage composition and herbivore performance.
   Budworm attained lower pupal weight when reared on trees with high
   levels of gout. In unthinned stands moderate gout reduced budworm
   survivorship, but there was no such effect in thinned stands. Gout did
   not affect budworm sex ratio. Although our data are consistent with
   interactions mediated by foliage quality (rather than quantity), and
   although budworm survivorship was associated with several aspects of
   foliage chemistry (Mg and N, positive; monoterpenes, negative), we were
   unable to identify specific host quality changes underlying the
   adelgid-budworm interaction. Our study demonstrates that A. piceae
   attack is an important factor influencing budworm performance, and it
   should be considered when analyzing budworm population dynamics and when
   developing management protocols for forests impacted by A. piceae
   attack. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional explorations of interspecific interactions have generated
   extensive bodies of theory on mutualism and disease independently, but
   few studies have considered the interaction between them. We developed a
   model exploring the interactions among a fungal mutualist, a viral
   pathogen, and their shared plant host. Both microbes were assumed to
   alter the uptake and use of nutrients by the plant. We found that the
   productivity of the system and the strength of the plant-fungal
   mutualism influenced community dynamics. In particular, at low
   productivity, the pathogen may depend on the presence of the fungal
   mutualist for persistence. Furthermore, under some conditions, both the
   productivity of the system and the strength of the plant-fungal
   mutualism may simultaneously cause the mutualist to go extinct. We note
   the presence of cyclic plant-pathogen population dynamics only in the
   presence of the mutualist. As found in other models of consumer-resource
   interactions, cyclic dynamics were driven by high productivity, but, in
   contrast to simpler systems, high pathogen effectiveness did not
   consistently lead to cyclic dynamics. In total, association with
   mutualists can alter host-pathogen interactions, and the reverse is also
   true in that pathogens may alter host-mutualist interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a theoretical hypothesis was proposed that the coexistence of

   from an analysis of community model, which was developed based on two

   different interaction types, antagonism and mutualism, have
   quantitatively comparable magnitude of effects to population growth; and
   (ii) interaction strength decreases with increasing interaction links of
   the same interaction type. However, those assumptions do not necessarily
   hold in real ecosystems, leaving unclear how robust this hypothesis is.
   Here, using a model with those two assumptions relaxed, we show (i) that
   the balance of interaction strength is necessary for the positive
   complexity effect to arise and (ii) that interaction-type diversity

Abstract = {{Mutualists and antagonists are known to respond to similar floral cues,
   and may thus cause opposing selection on floral traits. However, we lack
   a quantitative understanding of their independent and interactive
   effects. In a population of the orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, we
   manipulated the intensity of pollination and herbivory in a factorial
   design to examine whether both interactions influence selection on
   flowering phenology, floral display, and morphology. Supplemental
   hand-pollination increased female fitness by 31\% and one-quarter of all
   plants were damaged by herbivores. Both interactions contributed to
   selection. Pollinators mediated selection for later flowering and
   herbivores for earlier flowering, while both selected for longer spurs.
   The strength of selection was similar for both agents, and their effects
   were additive. As a consequence, there was no net selection on
   phenology, whereas selection on spur length was strong. The experimental
   results demonstrate that both pollinators and herbivores can markedly
   influence the strength of selection on flowering phenology and floral
   morphology, and cause both conflicting and reinforcing selection. They
   also indicate that the direction of selection on phenology will vary

Abstract = {{Trophic cascades are important drivers of plant and animal abundances in
   aquatic and aboveground systems, but in soils trophic cascades have been
   thought to be of limited importance due to omnivory and other factors.
   Here we use a meta-analysis of 215 studies with 1526 experiments that
   measured plant growth responses to additions or removals of soil
   organisms to test how different soil trophic levels affect plant growth.
   Consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis, we found that herbivores
   and plant pathogens (henceforth pests) decreased plant growth and that
   predators of pests increased plant growth. The magnitude of this trophic
   cascade was similar to that reported for aboveground systems. In
   contrast, we did not find evidence for trophic cascades in decomposer-
   and symbiont-based (henceforth mutualist) food chains. In these food
   chains, mutualists increased plant growth and predators of mutualists
   also increased plant growth, presumably by increasing nutrient cycling
   rates. Therefore, mutualists, predators of mutualists and predators of
   pests all increased plant growth. Further, experiments that added
   multiple organisms from different trophic levels also increased plant
   growth. As a result, across the dataset, soil organisms increased plant
   growth 29\% and non-pest soil organisms increased plant growth 46\%.
   Omnivory has traditionally been thought to confound soil trophic
   dynamics, but here we suggest that omnivory allows for a simplified
   perspective of soil food webs - one in which most soil organisms
   increase plant growth by preying on pests or increasing nutrient cycling
   rates. An implication of this perspective is that processes that
   decrease soil organism abundance (e.g. soil tillage) are likely to
   decrease aboveground productivity. <boxed-text content-type={''}all{''}

Abstract = {{Bacteria in the genus Streptomyces are ubiquitous in soil and are
   well-known for their production of diverse secondary metabolites,
   including antibiotics that can inhibit soil-borne plant pathogens and
   suppress disease. Pathogen-suppressive soil bacteria have the potential
   to influence plant community composition and diversity, but remain
   relatively unexplored in tropical forest soils. To estimate the
   potential for disease suppression among Streptomyces communities in
   tropical dry forests, we cultured soil-borne Streptomyces from plots in
   two forests in northwestern Costa Rica (Santa Rosa and Palo Verde) and
   quantified antibiotic-mediated pathogen inhibition against three plant
   pathogens. The potential for pathogen inhibition and disease suppression
   by Streptomyces was highly variable across the landscape. Densities of
   pathogen-suppressive Streptomyces varied by over ten-fold and were
   correlated with soil nutrients across the plots. In particular,
   Streptomyces communities became more pathogen-suppressive as labile soil
   P decreased. Inhibitor densities were significantly higher in Santa Rosa
   than Palo Verde, which may be related to differences in soil texture
   and/or plant community composition between the two forests. Our findings
   suggest potential differences in the degree and specificity of
   antibiotic-mediated disease suppression in tropical dry forest soils of
   Costa Rica, and highlight the need for further studies on the drivers of
   pathogen-suppressive phenotypes as well as the consequences of spatially
   variable pathogen inhibition for plant community composition in tropical
   forest ecosystems.
   Resumen Las bacterias del genero Streptomyces son ubicuas en el suelo y
   son conocidas por su capacidad de producir diversos metabolitos
   secundarios. Estos incluyen antibioticos que pueden inhibir
   fitopatogenos del suelo y disminuir enfermedades. Las bacterias que
   suprimen el crecimiento de patogenos pueden influir en la composicion y
   la diversidad de comunidades de plantas, pero han sido poco estudiadas
   en suelos de bosques tropicales. Para estimar el potencial de supresion
   de enfermedades de diferentes comunidades de Streptomyces en el bosque
   tropical seco, cultivamos Streptomyces de muestras de suelo colectadas
   en parcelas en dos bosques en la region Noroeste de Costa Rica, y
   cuantificamos la frecuencia e intensidad de inhibicion de tres patogenos
   vegetales. El potencial de inhibicion de patogenos y supresion de
   enfermedad de Streptomyces fue muy variable entre sitios. Las densidades
   de Streptomyces supresoras de patogenos variaron mas de diez veces y se
   observo una correlacion entre la densidad de bacterias y la
   concentracion de nutrientes en el suelo de las parcelas.
   Especificamente, hubo mayor supresion de patogenos en suelos con bajas
   concentraciones de fosforo labil. Las densidades de inhibidores fueron
   significativamente mayores en Santa Rosa que en Palo Verde, lo que puede
   estar relacionado con las diferencias en la textura del suelo y/o
   diferencias en la composicion de las comunidades vegetales entre los dos
   sitios. Nuestros resultados sugieren que existen diferencias en el grado
   y la especificidad de la supresion de enfermedades mediada por
   antibioticos en suelos del bosque tropical seco de Costa Rica, y
   resaltan la necesidad de mas estudios acerca de los factores que
   influyen en la presencia de diferentes fenotipos supresores de
   patogenos, asi como las consecuencias de la variacion espacial de la
   inhibicion de patogenos para la composicion de las comunidades vegetales

Abstract = {{Salt stress limits crop yield and sustainable agriculture in most arid
   and semiarid regions of the world. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   are considered bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. In
   evaluating AMF as significant predictors of mycorrhizal ecology, precise
   quantifiable changes in plant biomass and nutrient uptake under salt
   stress are crucial factors. Therefore, the objective of the present
   study was to analyze the magnitude of the effects of AMF inoculation on
   growth and nutrient uptake of plants under salt stress through
   meta-analyses. For this, data were compared in the context of
   mycorrhizal host plant species, plant family and functional group,
   herbaceous vs. woody plants, annual vs. perennial plants, and the level
   of salinity across 43 studies. Results indicate that, under saline
   conditions, AMF inoculation significantly increased total, shoot, and
   root biomass as well as phosphorous (P), nitrogen (N), and potassium (K)
   uptake. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase,
   catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase also increased
   significantly in mycorrhizal compared to nonmycorrhizal plants growing
   under salt stress. In addition, sodium (Na) uptake decreased
   significantly in mycorrhizal plants, while changes in proline
   accumulation were not significant. Across most subsets of the data
   analysis, identities of AMF (Glomus fasciculatum) and host plants
   (Acacia nilotica, herbs, woody and perennial) were found to be essential
   in understanding plant responses to salinity stress. For the analyzed
   dataset, it is concluded that under salt stress, mycorrhizal plants have
   extensive root traits and mycorrhizal morphological traits which help
   the uptake of more P and K, together with the enhanced production of
   antioxidant enzymes resulting in salt stress alleviation and increased
   plant biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Coral guard-crabs in the genus Trapezia are well-documented defenders of
   their pocilloporid coral hosts against coral predators such as the
   Crown-of-Thorns seastar (Acanthaster planci complex). The objectives of
   this study were to examine the protective services of six species of
   Trapezia against corallivory, and the extent of functional diversity
   among these Trapezia species.
   Studies conducted in Mo'orea, French Polynesia showed the Trapezia-coral
   mutualism protected the host corals from multiple predators through
   functional diversity in the assemblage of crab symbionts. Species
   differed in their defensive efficacy, but species within similar size
   classes shared similar abilities. Smallersize Trapezia species, which
   were previously thought to be ineffective guards, play important
   defensive roles against small corallivores.
   We also measured the benefits of this mutualism to corals in the midst
   of an Acanthaster outbreak that reduced the live coral cover on the fore
   reef to less than 4\%. The mutualism may positively affect the reef
   coral demography and potential for recovery during adverse predation
   events through shelter of multiple species of small corals near the host
   coral. Our results show that while functional diversity is supported
   within the genus, some Trapezia species may be functionally equivalent
   within the same size class, decreasing the threat of gaps in coral
   protection caused by absence or replacement of any single Trapezia
   species.}},

   number of flowers and per plant visitation rate, and there was a
   significant interaction between herbivory and flower number suggesting
   that the change in visitation rate was not solely a function of a
   reduction in flower abundance. Herbivory also had direct negative
   impacts on the reproductive success of Dalmatian toadflax. Total flower
   and fruit production decreased by over 30 \% in plants attacked by M.

Abstract = {{The net effects of interspecific species interactions on individuals and

   Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or
   magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While
   context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is
   poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in
   species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for
   247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the
   magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and
   while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and
   predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from
   competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied
   the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of
   the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context
   dependency across these context types was not consistent among
   mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study
   location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency,

Abstract = {{Plants are often attacked by pathogens and insects. Their combined
   impact on plant performance and fitness depends on complicated three-way

   Here, we evaluate the response of Barbarea vulgaris, a wild crucifer, to
   combined attack by an oomycete Albugo sp., a plant pathogen causing
   white rust, and a flea beetle, Phyllotreta nemorum. Plants from two B.
   vulgaris types that differ in resistance to P. nemorum were exposed to
   Albugo and P. nemorum alone and in combination and then monitored for
   pathogen infection, herbivore damage, defence compounds, nutritional
   quality, biomass and seed production. Albugo developed infections in the
   insect-resistant plants, whereas insect-susceptible plants were scarcely
   infected. Concentrations of Albugo DNA were higher in plants also
   exposed to herbivory; similarly, flea beetle larvae caused more damage
   on Albugo-infected plants. Concentrations of saponins and glucosinolates
   strongly increased when the plants were exposed to P. nemorum and when
   the insect-susceptible plants were exposed to Albugo, and some of these
   compounds increased even more in the combined treatment. The biomass of
   young insect-susceptible plants was lower following exposure to flea
   beetles, and the number of leaves of both plant types was negatively
   affected by combined exposure. After flowering, however, adult plants
   produced similar numbers of viable seeds, irrespective of treatment. Our
   findings support the concept that pathogens and herbivores can affect
   each other's performance on a host plant and that the plant reacts by
   inducing specific and general defences. However, plants may be able to
   compensate for biomass loss from single and combined attacks over time.}},

Abstract = {{Most organisms interact with multiple mutualistic species that confer

   explicitly characterized the mechanisms and fitness consequences of
   resource exchange, but have not been extended to functionally divergent
   partners. First, we merge these approaches using graphical models to
   define the multiple mutualist effects (MMEs) that occur when a focal
   species has multiple partner mutualists. This approach mirrors food web
   research that has been advanced by studies of multiple predator effects
   as well as by detailed investigations of modules nested within larger
   networks. Second, we define the pathways through which a focal mutualist
   and two or more partner species could interact, reviewing examples of
   MMEs that span a range from positive to negative fitness effects. Third,
   given the potential for nonadditivity demonstrated by the existing
   literature, we pose new hypotheses for species-interaction outcomes by
   examining factors such as the extent of overlap in rewards exchanged

Abstract = {{Biotic interactions play primary roles in major theories of the
   distribution and abundance of species, yet the nature of these biotic
   interactions can depend upon the larger ecological community. Leguminous
   plants, for example, commonly associate with both arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) and rhizobia bacteria, and the pairwise interactions may
   depend upon the presence or identity of the third partner. To determine
   if the dynamics of plant-AMF and plant-rhizobia interactions are
   affected by the alternate symbiont, we manipulated the presence and
   identity of each symbiont, as well as levels of the nutrients supplied
   by each symbiont (nitrogen and phosphorus), on the growth of prairie
   legume Amorpha canescens. We found strong synergistic effects of AMF and
   rhizobia inoculation on plant biomass production that were independent
   of nutrient levels. AMF and rhizobia responses were each influenced by
   the other, but not in the same direction. AMF infection increased root
   nodule number and mass, but rhizobia inoculation decreased AMF hyphal
   colonization of roots. The relative benefits of each combination of
   symbionts depended upon phosphorus level. The effect of nitrogen was
   also contingent on the biotic environment where nitrogen addition
   decreased nodulation, but this decrease was reduced with coinfection by
   AMF. Our results demonstrate a strong contingency on the co-occurrence
   of AMF and rhizobia for the long-term fitness of A. canescens, and
   suggest that the belowground community is critical for the success of
   this species in tallgrass prairies.}},

Abstract = {{Damage by small herbivores can have disproportionately large effects on
   the fitness of individual plants if damage is concentrated on valuable
   tissues or on select individuals within a population. In marine systems,
   the impact of tissue loss on the growth rates of habitat-forming algae
   is poorly understood. We quantified the grazing damage by an isopod
   Amphoroidea typa on two species of large kelps, Lessonia spicata and
   Macrocystis pyrifera, in temperate Chile to test whether non-lethal
   grazing damage could reduce kelp growth rates and photosynthetic
   efficiency. For L. spicata, grazing damage was widespread in the field,
   unevenly distributed on several spatial scales (among individuals and
   among tissue types) and negatively correlated with blade growth rates.
   In field experiments, feeding by A. typa reduced the concentration of
   photosynthetic pigments and led to large reductions (similar to 80 \%)
   in blade growth rates despite limited loss of kelp biomass (0.5 \% per
   day). For M. pyrifera, rates of damage in the field were lower and high
   densities of grazers were unable to reduce growth rates in field
   experiments. These results demonstrate that even low per capita grazing
   rates can result in large reductions in the growth of a kelp, due the
   spatial clustering of herbivores in the field and the selective removal
   of photosynthetically active tissues. The impacts of small herbivores on
   plant performance are thus not easily predicted from consumption rates
   or abundance in the field, and vary with plant species due to variation
   in their ability to compensate for damage.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a large body of literature that describes the effects of

   plants, herbaceous vs. woody plants, field vs. greenhouse conditions,
   degree of stress, functional group, regions of plant growth, and
   mycorrhizal and host species. We found that, in terms of biomass
   measurements, mycorrhizal plants have better growth and reproductive
   response under water stress compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. When
   variables such as habit, life cycle, or water stress level are
   considered, differences in mycorrhizal effect on plant growth between
   variables are observed. While growth of both annual and perennial plants
   is improved by symbiosis, perennials respond more favorably to
   colonization than annuals. Overall, our meta-analysis reveals a

Abstract = {{Herbivore damage often deters pollinator visitation and many invasive
   plants in North America are pollinator-dependent. This has important
   implications for the biological control of invasive plants because it
   means that agents that deter pollinators may have a larger than expected
   impact on the plant. Yet interactions between pollinators and biocontrol
   agents are rarely evaluated. Centaurea solstitialis, one of the most
   problematic invasive species in California, is dependent on pollinators
   for reproduction. I factorially manipulated infection by a biocontrol
   pathogen and pollen supplementation to test for (1) pollen limitation in
   C. solstitialis, (2) whether infection increased pollen limitation, and
   (3) whether this varied across a soil moisture gradient. Plants growing
   on north-facing slopes where soil moisture was higher experienced mild
   pollen limitation in the absence of the pathogen and more pronounced
   pollen limitation when they were infected. Plants on drier south-facing
   slopes did not suffer from pollen limitation but instead appeared to
   suffer from resource limitation. Pathogen infection directly reduced
   seed set in C. solstitialis by 67-72 \%. On north-facing slopes,
   infection had an additional, indirect effect by increasing the degree of
   pollen limitation plants experienced. The trait that mediates this
   indirect pathogen-pollinator interaction is the number of inflorescences
   plants produced: infected plants made fewer inflorescences which led to
   greater pollen limitation. Although in the present study this outcome is
   dependent on abiotic factors that vary over small spatial scales,
   exploiting other invasive plants' dependence on pollinators by selecting
   agents that deter visitation may enhance agent impact.}},

Abstract = {{Strong competition from invasive plant species often leads to declines
   in abundances and may, in certain cases, cause localized extinctions of
   native plant species. Nevertheless, studies have shown that certain
   populations of native plant species can co-exist with invasive plant
   species, suggesting the possibility of adaptive evolutionary responses
   of those populations to the invasive plants. Empirical inference of
   evolutionary responses of the native plant species to invasive plants
   has involved experiments comparing two conspecific groups of native
   plants for differences in expression of growth/reproductive traits:
   populations that have experienced competition from the invasive plant
   species (i.e. experienced natives) versus populations with no known
   history of interactions with the invasive plant species (i.e. naive
   natives). Here, I employ a meta-analysis to obtain a general pattern of
   inferred evolutionary responses of native plant species from 53 such
   studies. In general, the experienced natives had significantly higher
   growth/reproductive performances than naive natives, when grown with or
   without competition from invasive plants. While the current results

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can facilitate nutrient uptake and
   increase host plant growth but also place constraints on the host's
   carbon budget. When plants are stressed by herbivory the net effect of
   the symbiosis may be altered tolerance. Individual experiments
   manipulating AM fungi and herbivory have demonstrated increased,
   decreased, and no effect on tolerance but patterns with respect to
   plant, herbivore, or fungus characteristics have not emerged.
   Meta-analysis of published results from factorial experiments was used
   to describe the size of the effects of herbivory and of AM fungi on host
   growth when factors such as cause of damage, inoculum, and host
   characteristics are considered, and to determine whether AM fungi alter
   the effects of herbivory. Also, the correlation between the effect of AM
   fungi on tolerance and resistance was tested with data from studies that
   examined insect performance. Herbivory strongly and consistently reduced
   shoot and root growth, especially in perennial plants and crops. AM
   fungi increased shoot growth of perennials but not annuals, and when
   insects caused damage but not when artificial defoliation was applied.
   Root growth was consistently greater with AM fungi. The interaction of
   AM fungi and herbivory, which indicates whether AM fungi alter the
   effects of herbivory, was variable and never significant overall but
   homogeneity tests indicated underlying structure. In experiments that
   used single species inoculum, Glomus intraradices increased, whereas
   Glomus mosseae reduced, effects of herbivory on shoot growth.
   Multispecies inocula magnified effects of herbivory on root growth
   whereas single species inocula ameliorated effects. The impact of AM
   fungi on resistance to herbivory was positively correlated with the
   impact on tolerance; however AM fungi reduced both tolerance and
   resistance in many cases. Review of these results with respect to the
   types of systems studied suggests directions for future investigation.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. We review the effects of root and shoot competition on plant biomass
   by meta-analysis of 38 published studies, each reporting on the
   factorial effects of root-competition and shoot-competition on
   herbaceous plants.
   2. There were significant differences in the overall effects of root,
   shoot and full competition. Root competition generally resulted in
   larger biomass reduction than shoot competition, particularly among the
   smaller of the two competitors. An interaction between root and shoot
   competition was observed in some experiments but was generally not
   significant.
   3. While root competition was generally stronger than shoot competition
   at lower nutrient levels, there was no overall difference at higher
   nutrient levels due to much lower levels of root competition. In
   contrast, the overall effect of full competition increased considerably
   with nutrient level.
   4. Root competition was generally more important when the neighbour was
   a grass as compared with a herb or a legume, and when domesticated
   plants competed with wild neighbours, suggesting that wild genotypes are
   stronger competitors for below-ground resources than are crop plants.
   5. Effects of competition were generally stronger in experiments with
   additive designs than in those with substitutive designs. Also,
   experiments using single target individuals showed stronger effects of
   competition, root competition in particular, than did experiments using
   groups targets.
   6. Synthesis. Despite large variation among experiments, some general
   patterns were supported: effects of root competition are generally
   stronger than shoot competition, particularly (i) for smaller
   competitors, (ii) at low fertility levels, (iii) when the competitor is
   a grass rather than an herb, (iv) when the competitor is a wild rather
   than a domesticated species, and (v) in additive design experiments. The
   effects of root and shoot competition appear to be additive under many
   conditions. Whereas root competition may often be the primary limitation
   on mean plant performance, shoot competition will influence the
   variation around this mean and may determine which individuals or
   species dominate.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic modifications of the landscape, such as agriculture, are
   widespread globally and can reduce native biodiversity and homogenize
   communities by decreasing variation in species composition across sites.
   Partitioning anthropogenic impacts among species that have positive
   versus negative effects on plants may improve our ability to forecast
   the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these alterations in
   communities. Here, we manipulated the distance of populations of a wild
   sunflower species (Helianthus annuus texanus) to fields of its
   domesticated relative (crop sunflowers, H. annuus) and contrasted
   subsequent shifts in the abundance and community composition of
   mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (seed predators, folivores) of
   H. a. texanus. With some exceptions, populations of H. a. texanus near
   crop sunflowers supported higher numbers of pollinators than those far
   from crop sunflowers. In contrast, in the majority of cases, populations
   of H. a. texanus supported more seed predators when located far from
   crop sunflowers. Folivore damage to plants was greater far from crop
   sunflowers, and was never greater near crop sunflowers. Contrary to the
   prediction that proximity to agriculture homogenizes community
   composition, we found beta-diversity of pollinators (species turnover
   between populations) was greater near crop sunflowers. Our results
   demonstrate that mutualists and antagonists of a wild plant species
   respond differently to the proximity of a related crop species,
   indicating the potential for both altered population dynamics and
   complex selection pressures on wild species in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation within and among foundation plant species is known to

   how Populus genetic differences at the level of species and hybrids
   affect fungal leaf pathogen communities in the wild, specifically in a
   natural Populus hybridization zone (13 river km) and throughout the
   larger Weber River watershed (150 river km). In the common garden,
   genetic variation both within and among Populus species and hybrids
   significantly affected the structure (i.e. species abundances and

Abstract = {{Plants form ubiquitous associations with diverse microbes. These

   resource supplies that are being altered by global change. While many
   studies have considered the separate effects of pathogens and mutualists

   microbial mutualists and pathogens in the context of global change.
   Using two wild grass species as model hosts, we grew individual plants
   under ambient or elevated CO2, and ambient or increased soil phosphorus
   (P) supply. Additionally, individuals were grown with or without
   arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum, and after 2wk, plants were inoculated
   or mock-inoculated with a phloem-restricted virus. Under elevated CO2,
   mycorrhizal association increased the titer of virus infections, and
   virus infection reciprocally increased the colonization of roots by
   mycorrhizal fungi. Additionally, virus infection decreased plant
   allocation to root biomass, increased leaf P, and modulated effects of
   CO2 and P addition on mycorrhizal root colonization. These results
   indicate that plant mutualists and pathogens can alter each other's
   success, and predict that these interactions will respond to increased
   resource availability and elevated CO2. Together, our findings highlight

Abstract = {{While plants are invariably attacked by numerous insects and pathogens,

   we conduct an analysis of 74 unique plant-enemy-enemy combinations from

   natural enemies on host plant performance, and test a number of a priori
   predictions for determinants of independent and antagonistic effects of

   enemies had independent effects on plant performance. In most of the
   remainder, multiple enemies led to less reduction in performance than
   that predicted from each enemy alone. Antagonistic effects occurred when
   enemies attacked the same plant part concurrently or attacked plant
   reproductive structures. These two predictors explained why antagonistic
   effects were particularly prevalent for weeds, plants in the family
   Asteraceae and enemies in the order Diptera. Our results suggest that a
   few simple rules about avoiding particular combinations of multiple

Title = {{Combined effects of arthropod herbivores and phytopathogens on plant

Abstract = {{Many plants are simultaneously attacked by arthropod herbivores and
   phytopathogens. These may affect each other directly and indirectly,
   enhancing or reducing the amount of plant resources they each consume.
   Ultimately, this may reduce or enhance plant performance relative to
   what should be expected from the added impacts of herbivore and pathogen
   when they attack alone. Previous studies have suggested synergistic and
   antagonistic impacts on plant performance from certain combinations of
   arthropods and pathogens, for example, synergistic impacts from
   necrotrophic pathogens together with wounding arthropods because of
   facilitated infection and antagonistic impacts from induction of
   pathogen resistance by sucking herbivores. We compiled published studies
   on the impact of plantherbivorepathogen interactions on plant
   performance and used meta-analysis to search for consistent patterns of
   impacts among plant, herbivore and pathogen characteristics and
   experimental conditions, and to test the suggested hypotheses on
   synergistic or antagonistic impacts. None of the hypotheses based on
   proximate interactions between arthropods and pathogens were supported
   by our analysis; in contrast, the patterns we found were related to
   plant traits and experimental conditions. Our results suggest that
   immediate loss of resources from interactions between arthropod
   herbivores and pathogens is generally moderated by compensation to an
   extent where there are no interactive effects on plant performance.
   However, as interactive impacts also differed among environments and
   parasite manipulation methods, this suggests that the ability of plants
   to compensate such losses may depend on environmental conditions and
   probably also overall infection load.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{172}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effect of herbivory on plant performance is the subject of a large
   number of ecological studies, and plant responses to herbivory range
   from reduced reproduction to overcompensation. Because plant defenses,
   stored resources, and allocation demands change throughout a plant's
   lifetime, it can be hypothesized the effects of herbivory also vary with
   development. The present work extends previous analyses to incorporate
   hundreds of studies in a new meta-analysis addressing this topic.
   Herbivores had an overall negative effect on plant growth and
   reproduction, and, in contrast to a previous meta-analysis, this work
   shows the timing of herbivory is relevant. Differences in the effects of
   herbivory between life stages existed for woody plant reproduction and
   perennial herb growth. In addition, tree and shrub growth was reduced by
   herbivore damage at early ontogenetic stages, and perennial herb
   reproduction was limited by adult stage herbivory. These results
   partially support the continuum of an ontogenetic response model.
   Finally, consideration of this synthesis in conjunction with other work
   led to the conclusion that different plant groups optimize their defense
   investments in unique ways. Slow-growing plants may strongly chemically
   defend young tissues, supporting the plant-age hypothesis, because early
   herbivory is detrimental to growth. Faster-growing herbs may invest more
   in antiherbivore defense when they are older, supporting the
   growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, because later herbivory
   limits their reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Ocean acidification and warming are considered two of the greatest
   threats to marine biodiversity, yet the combined effect of these
   stressors on marine organisms remains largely unclear. Using a
   meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine
   organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation
   and combination. As expected biological responses varied across
   taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but
   importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger
   biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of
   orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological
   responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and
   survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and
   acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting
   stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from
   single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the
   development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that
   the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely
   to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward
   more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change

Abstract = {{The majority of angiosperms are hermaphroditic with total fitness
   comprised of both male and female components of reproduction. However,
   most studies examining the effects of abiotic factors and species
   interactions on fitness have focussed on female reproduction,
   potentially biasing our understanding of the consequences of
   environmental factors on total fitness. Here, we use meta-analysis to
   test how environmental factors affect male function. We obtained 278
   effect sizes from 96 studies that measured male function responses to
   manipulated environmental factors. We found significant effects of
   abiotic factors and species interactions on estimates of male function,
   with responses varying depending on environmental factor identity. Male
   and female responses were correlated for abiotic factor manipulations,
   but varied based on the type of species interaction (antagonistic or
   mutualistic). This suggests that measuring only female function may
   misrepresent whole-plant reproduction depending on context. Finally, we
   found differences amongst components of male function in response to
   environmental factors, suggesting that some male function estimates may
   fail to capture the effects of environmental factors on male fitness.
   Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating male function
   into ecological and evolutionary studies to provide a more accurate

Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecosystem service which most often has been studied

Abstract = {{Plant species introduced to new regions can escape their natural enemies
   but may also lose important mutualists. While mutualistic interactions
   are often considered too diffuse to limit plant invasion, few studies
   have quantified the strength of interactions in both the native and
   introduced ranges, and assessed whether any differences are linked to
   invasion outcomes. For three Acacia species adapted for ant dispersal
   (myrmecochory), we quantified seed removal probabilities associated with
   dispersal and predation in both the native (Australian) and introduced
   (New Zealand) ranges, predicting lower removal attributable to dispersal
   in New Zealand due to a relatively depauperate ant fauna. We used the
   role of the elaiosome to infer myrmecochory, and included treatments to
   measure vertebrate seed removal, since this may become an important
   determinant of seed fate in the face of reduced dispersal. We then
   tested whether differences in seed removal patterns could explain
   differences in the invasion success of the three Acacia species in New
   Zealand.
   Overall seed removal by invertebrates was lower in New Zealand relative
   to Australia, but the difference in removal between seeds with an
   elaiosome compared to those without was similar in both countries. This
   implies that the probability of a removed seed being dispersed by
   invertebrates was comparable in New Zealand to Australia. The
   probability of seed removal by vertebrates was similar and low in both
   countries. Differences in the invasive success of the three Acacia
   species in New Zealand were not explained by differences in levels of
   seed predation or the strength of myrmecochorous interactions. These
   findings suggest that interactions with ground foraging seed predators
   and dispersers are unlikely to limit the ability of Acacia species to
   spread in New Zealand, and could not explain their variable invasion
   success. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{After removing invasive plants, whether by herbicides or other means,
   typical restoration design focuses on rebuilding native plant
   communities while disregarding soil microbial communities. However,
   microbialplant interactions are known to influence the relative success
   of native versus invasive plants. Therefore, the abundance and
   composition of soil microorganisms may affect restoration efforts. We
   assessed the effect of herbicide treatment on phytosymbiotic
   pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic (PPFM) bacteria and the
   potential consequences of native and invasive species establishment
   post-herbicide treatment in the lab and in a coastal sage scrub
   (CSS)/grassland restoration site. Lab tests showed that 4\% glyphosate
   reduced PPFM abundance. PPFM addition to seeds increased seedling length
   of a native plant (Artemisia californica) but not an invasive plant
   (Hirschfeldia incana). At the restoration site, methanol addition (a
   PPFM substrate) improved native bunchgrass (Nassella pulchra)
   germination and size by 35\% over controls. In a separate multispecies
   field experiment, PPFM addition stimulated the germination of N.
   pulchra, but not that of three invasive species. Neither PPFM nor
   methanol addition strongly affected the growth of any plant species.
   Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that PPFMs
   have a greater benefit to native than invasive species. Together, these
   experiments suggest that methanol or PPFM addition could be useful in
   improving CSS/grassland restorations. Future work should test PPFM
   effects on additional species and determine how these results vary under

   southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative
   biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that

   management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and
   interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top
   predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary
   producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects

   (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative
   effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming
   with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding
   fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed
   the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic
   response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response
   level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size,

Abstract = {{Forests are important carbon sinks, but increasing temperatures may

   It is therefore important to predict the impact of insect defoliation on

   We conducted a meta-analysis based on 45 study cases, to estimate the

   Overall, processionary moth defoliation had a significant impact on tree
   growth, regardless of the tree and moth species considered. Mean
   relative tree growth loss increased with the rate of defoliation
   levelling out at ca. 50 \%; it was significantly larger for young than
   for old trees.
   These results suggest that estimates of processionary moth defoliation

Abstract = {{Herbivores affect plants through direct effects, such as tissue damage,
   and through indirect effects that alter species interactions.
   Interactions may be positive or negative, so indirect effects have the
   potential to enhance or lessen the net impacts of herbivores. Despite
   the ubiquity of these interactions, the indirect pathways are
   considerably less understood than the direct effects of herbivores, and
   multiple indirect pathways are rarely studied simultaneously. We placed
   herbivore effects in a comprehensive community context by studying how
   herbivory influences plant interactions with antagonists and mutualists
   both aboveground and belowground. We manipulated early-season
   aboveground herbivore damage to Cucumis sativus (cucumber,
   Cucurbitaceae) and measured interactions with subsequent aboveground
   herbivores, root-feeding herbivores, pollinators, and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We quantified plant growth and reproduction and
   used an enhanced pollination treatment to determine if plants were
   pollen limited. Increased herbivory reduced interactions with both
   antagonists and mutualists. Plants with high levels of early herbivory
   were significantly less likely to suffer leaf damage later in the summer
   and tended to be less attacked by root herbivores. Herbivory also
   reduced pollinator visitation, likely due to fewer and smaller flowers,
   and reduced AMF colonization. The net effect of herbivory on plant
   growth and reproduction was strongly negative, but lower fruit and seed
   production were not due to reduced pollinator visits, because
   reproduction was not pollen limited. Although herbivores influenced
   interactions between plants and other organisms, these effects appear to
   be weaker than the direct negative effects of early-season tissue loss.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in belowground herbivory and the remarkable diversity
   of the accumulated information on this topic inspired us to
   quantitatively explore the variation in the outcomes of individual
   studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of 85 experimental studies
   reporting the effects of root-feeding insect herbivores (36 species) on
   plants (75 species). On average, belowground herbivory led to a 36.3\%
   loss of root biomass, which was accompanied by a reduction in
   aboveground growth (-16.3\%), photosynthesis (-11.7\%) and reproduction
   (-15.5\%). The effects of root herbivory on aboveground plant
   characteristics were significant in agricultural and biological control
   studies, but not in studies of natural systems. Experiments conducted in
   controlled environments yielded larger effects on plants than field
   experiments, and infestation experiments resulted in more severe effects
   than removal studies employing natural levels of herbivory. Simulated
   root herbivory led to greater aboveground growth reductions than similar
   root loss imposed by insect feeding. External root chewers caused
   stronger detrimental effects than sap feeders or root borers; specialist
   herbivores imposed milder adverse effects on plants than generalists.
   Woody plants suffered from root herbivory more than herbaceous plants,
   although root loss was similar in these two groups. Evergreen woody
   plants responded to root herbivory more strongly than deciduous woody
   plants, and grasses suffered from root herbivory more than herbs.
   Environmental factors such as drought, poor nutrient supply, among-plant
   competition, and aboveground herbivory increased the adverse effects of
   root damage on plants in an additive manner. In general, plant tolerance
   to root herbivores is lower than tolerance to defoliating aboveground
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Many biological control projects involve the release of multiple agents.
   Ageratina adenophora (crofton weed) has two agents, Procecidochares
   utilis, a stem gall fly, and Passalora ageratinae, a leaf-spot fungal
   pathogen, released against it in South Africa. This study investigated
   whether both agents, individually or jointly, increased or decreased the
   impact on crofton weed under greenhouse conditions. Six-month-old plants
   were exposed to one of six treatments (n = 15 plants/treatment): control
   (no agents), pathogen-only, single-galled only, double-galled only,
   pathogen-single-galled, and pathogen-double-galled, all for a period of
   6 months. Individually, both of the agents reduced stem height and
   percentage of live leaves, but there was no synergistic effect of the
   two agents together. Pathogen-double-galled stems had significantly
   fewer pathogen-infected leaves relative to the other pathogen-infected
   treatment stems, suggesting a negative interaction between the two
   agents on pathogen establishment. Pathogen infection did not affect the
   size of the galls. Double galling by the fly inhibited stem growth above
   the gall position on the stem. Crofton weed compensated for galling by
   increasing the number of sideshoots. The pathogen inhibited sideshoot
   growth, thereby curbing the plant's ability to offset galling. Overall,
   there was an additive interaction between the two agents which enhances
   their usefulness as biocontrol agents of crofton weed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mutualisms are well known to influence individual fitness and the
   population dynamics of partner species, but little is known about
   whether they influence species distributions and the location of
   geographic range limits. Here, we examine the contribution of
   plant-pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the
   California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that
   pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the
   geographic range consistently across four years of study. This decline
   in pollinator availability was caused to a greater extent by variation
   in the abundance of generalist rather than specialist bee pollinators.
   Climate data suggest that patterns of precipitation in the current and
   previous year drove variation in bee abundance because of its effects on
   cues for bee emergence in the current year and the abundance of floral
   resources in the previous year. Experimental floral manipulations showed
   that marginal populations had greater outcross pollen limitation of
   reproduction, in parallel with the decline in pollinator abundance.
   Although plants are self-compatible, we found no evidence that
   autonomous selfing contributes to reproduction, and thus no evidence
   that it alleviates outcross pollen limitation in marginal populations.
   Furthermore, we found no association between the distance to the range
   edge and selfing rate, as estimated from sequence and microsatellite
   variation, indicating that the mating system has not evolved in response
   to the pollination environment at the range periphery. Overall, our
   results suggest that dependence on pollinators for reproduction may be
   an important constraint limiting range expansion in this system.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Mutualisms often involve one host supporting multiple symbionts, whose
   identity, density and intraguild interactions can influence the nature
   of the mutualism and performance of the host. However, the implications
   of multiple co-occurring symbionts on services to a host have rarely
   been quantified. In this study, we quantified effects of decapod
   symbionts on removal of sediment from their coral host. Our field survey
   showed that all common symbionts typically occur as pairs and never at
   greater abundances. Two species, the crab Trapezia serenei and the
   shrimp Alpheus lottini, were most common and co-occurred more often than
   expected by chance. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test for
   effects of decapod identity and density on sediment removal. Alone,
   corals removed 10\% of sediment, but removal increased to 30\% and 48\%
   with the presence of two and four symbionts, respectively. Per-capita
   effects of symbionts were independent of density and identity. Our
   results suggest that symbiont density is restricted by intraspecific
   competition. Thus, increased sediment removal from a coral host can only
   be achieved by increasing the number of species of symbionts on that
   coral, even though these species are functionally equivalent. Symbiont
   diversity plays a key role, not through added functionality but by
   overcoming density limitation likely imposed by intraspecific mating

Abstract = {{Host-specific mortality driven by natural enemies is a widely discussed
   mechanism for explaining plant diversity. In principle, populations of
   plant species can be regulated by distinct host-specific natural enemies
   that have weak or nonexistent effects on heterospecific competitors,
   preventing any single species from becoming dominant and thus promoting
   diversity. Two of the first steps in exploring the role of natural
   enemies in diversity regulation are to (1) identify potential enemies
   and (2) evaluate their levels of host specificity by determining if
   interactions between any one host and its enemy have equivalent survival
   impacts on co-occurring host species. We developed a bioinformatics
   framework to evaluate impacts of potential pathogens on seedling
   survival, for both single and multiple infections. Importantly, we
   consider scenarios not only if there are specialist pathogens for each
   plant, but also when generalist pathogens have differential effects on
   multiple host species, and when co-infection has species-specific
   effects. We then applied this analytical framework to a field experiment
   using molecular techniques to detect potential fungal pathogens on
   co-occurring tree seedling hosts. Combinatorial complexity created by
   160 plant-fungus interactions was reduced to eight combinations that
   affect seedling survival. Potential fungal pathogens had broad host
   ranges, but seedling species were each regulated by different
   combinations of fungi or by generalist fungi that had differential
   effects on multiple plant species. Soil moisture can have the potential
   to shift the nature of the interactions in some plant-fungal
   combinations from neutral to detrimental. Reassessing the assumption of
   single-enemy-single-host interactions broadens the mechanisms through
   which natural enemies can influence plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   In nature, plant communities are affected simultaneously by a variety of
   functionally dissimilar organisms both above and below the ground.
   However, there is a gap of knowledge on interactive effects of
   functionally dissimilar organisms on plant communities that is needed to
   be filled to better understand and predict the general impact of biotic
   factors on plant communities.
   Methods
   We conducted a full-factorial mesocosm study to investigate the
   individual and combined impacts of above-and belowground functionally
   dissimilar organisms on a grassland plant community. We studied the
   effects of aboveground herbivores (Helix aspersa, Gastropoda),
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomus spp., Glomero-mycota) and
   endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea spp., Lumbricidae) on the diversity,
   structure and productivity of an experimental grassland plant community
   and each other.
   Important Findings
   Aboveground herbivory by snails decreased, AMF increased and earthworms
   had no effects on the diversity of the grassland plant community, while
   their combined effects were additive. The biomass of the plant community
   was negatively affected by snails and AMF, while no effects of
   earthworms or interaction effects were found. The plant species were
   differently affected by snails and AMF. No effects of the above-and
   belowground organisms on each other's performance were detected. Since
   the effects of the functionally dissimilar organisms on the grassland
   plant community were mainly independent, the results indicate that their
   combined effects may be predicted by knowing the individual effects, at
   least under the conditions used in the present mesocosm study.}},

Abstract = {{Soil communities associated with specific plant species affect
   individual plants' growth and competitive ability. Limited evidence
   suggests that unique soil communities can also differentially influence
   growth and competition at the ecotype level. Previous work with
   Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that accessions produce distinct and
   reproducible rhizosphere bacterial communities, with significant
   differences in both species composition and relative abundance. We
   tested the hypothesis that soil communities uniquely affect the growth
   and reproduction of the plant accessions with which they are associated.
   Specifically, we examined the growth of four accessions when exposed to
   their own soil communities and the communities generated by each of the
   other three accessions. To do this we planted focal accessions inside a
   ring of six plants that created a ``background{''} soil community. We
   grew focal plants in this design in three separate soil treatments:
   non-sterile soil, sterilized soil, and ``preconditioned{''} soil. We
   preconditioned soil by growing accessions in non-sterile soil for six
   weeks before the start of the experiment. The main experiment was
   harvested after seven weeks of growth and we recorded height, silique
   number, and dry weight of each focal plant. Plants grown in the
   preconditioned soil treatment showed less growth relative to the
   non-sterile and sterile soil treatments. In addition, plants in the
   sterile soil grew larger than those in non-sterile soil. However, we saw
   no interaction between soil treatment and background accession. We
   conclude that the soil communities have a negative net impact on
   Arabidopsis thaliana growth, and that the unique soil communities
   associated with each accession do not differentially affect growth and
   competition of study species.}},

Abstract = {{A common effect size metric used to quantify the outcome of experiments

   Here, I derive new variances and covariances for RR for several
   often-encountered experimental designs: when the treatment and control

   when means are based on repeated measures; and when the study has a
   correlated factorial design, or is multivariate. These developments are

Abstract = {{Current competition theory does not adequately address the fact that
   competitors may affect the survival, growth, and reproductive rates of
   their resources. Ecologically important interactions in which consumers
   affect resource vital rates range from parasitism and herbivory to
   mutualism. We present a general model of competition that explicitly
   includes consumer-dependent resource vital rates. We build on the
   classic MacArthur model of competition for multiple resources, allowing
   direct comparison with expectations from established concepts of
   resource-use overlap. Consumers share a stage-structured resource
   population but may use the different stages to different extents, as
   they do the different independent resources in the classic model. Here,
   however, the stages are dynamically linked via consumer-dependent vital
   rates. We show that consumers' effects on resource vital rates result in
   two important departures from classic results. First, consumers can
   coexist despite identical use of resource stages, provided each
   competitor shifts the resource stage distribution toward stages that
   benefit other species. Second, consumers specializing on different

Abstract = {{The availability and quality of mutualists beyond a species' range edge
   may limit range expansion. With the legume Chamaecrista fasciculata, we
   asked to what extent the availability and quality of rhizobia beyond the
   range edge limits host range expansion. We tested the effect of rhizobia
   availability on plant growth by transplanting seed from three locations
   into five sites spanning C. fasciculata's range (interior, at the
   northern and western range edges, and beyond the range edges), and
   inoculating half the seeds with rhizobia. We recorded growth of all
   surviving plants, and, for the uninoculated plants, whether they had
   formed nodules or not. We isolated rhizobia from nodules collected on
   the uninoculated plants, and cross-inoculated seed from four populations
   (both range edge and interior populations) in the greenhouse to
   determine whether the quality of rhizobia differed between regions. We
   found that seeds transplanted beyond the range edge were less likely to
   be nodulated when they were not experimentally inoculated, and there was
   benefit to inoculation at all sites. In the greenhouse, the three
   inocula that formed nodules on plants, from the range interior, northern
   edge and beyond the northern edge, did not detectably differ in their
   effect on plant growth. These results suggest that low densities of
   suitable rhizobia beyond the range edge may limit range expansion of

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1311-1318}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The interactions between herbivores and plants are of general interest
   in ecology. Even though the extensive research carried out during the
   last decades has culminated in many theories, additional studies are
   necessary to validate these findings. In particular, the hypotheses
   dealing with the complex interrelations of plant defense mechanisms and
   herbivores continue to be debated.
   In this paper, we develop a new indicator value that quantifies the
   defense mechanisms of Central European woody plants against large
   mammalian herbivores. The indicator value is based on three
   plant-specific traits: chemical defense (toxic compounds, digestion
   inhibitors), mechanical defense and leaf size. Our validation of the
   newly established indicator shows that evergreen woody plants have a
   significantly higher indicator value than deciduous woody plants.
   Moreover, plant defense is correlated with growth height: woody plants
   growing in the browsing zone preferred by large mammalian herbivores
   have significantly higher levels of defense compared with woody plants
   capable of growth high above the reach of large herbivores.
   We conclude that the new plant defense indicator value is a valuable
   tool for the validation of existing hypotheses and habitat calibration
   on a statistical basis. The quantification of plant mechanisms of
   defense against large herbivores produces a significantly better
   understanding of the multifaceted nature of plant-animal interactions
   and should contribute positively to future studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Neotyphodium endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are common
   constituents of natural grasslands. The plant-endophyte symbiosis can
   introduce changes in soil conditions that affect the density and
   activity of different functional groups of soil organisms. In the
   present work we performed in vitro assays to evaluate the effect of root
   and endophyte exudates on the pre-infective state of mycorrhizal fungi
   (Gigaspora margarita and G. rosea). Plant roots of Bromus setifolius
   from populations of Patagonia, and four strains of Neotyphodium were
   used to obtain the exudates. Root exudates of infected plants, at a high
   concentration, significantly increased AMF hyphal branches and length
   relative to exudates from naturally endophyte free plants. The effect of
   Neotyphodium endophyte exudates on AMF mycelial length varied depending
   on strain and the concentration used, suggesting a differential
   interaction between endophyte and AMF species. AMF hyphal branches were
   increased by Neotyphodium fungal exudates in both mycorrhizal species. A
   few previous studies have suggested that Neotyphodium endophytes can
   reduce mycorrhizal sporulation and colonization of host roots in
   commonly-cultivated agronomic hosts. In this study we report the
   opposite effect in B. setifolius. This study reports the direct and
   positive effect of root exudates from plants in symbiosis with
   Neotyphodium, on AMF pre-infective state. Further, identical effects
   were detected using exudates from Neotyphodium endophytes.}},

Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Plants interact with above- and belowground
   organisms; the combined effects of these interactions determine plant
   fitness and trait evolution. To better understand the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of multispecies interactions, we explored
   linkages between soil fungi, pollinators, and floral larcenists in
   Polemonium viscosum (Polemoniaceae).
   Methods: Using a fungicide, we experimentally reduced fungal
   colonization of krummholz and tundra P. viscosum in 2008-2009. We
   monitored floral signals and rewards, interactions with pollinators and
   larcenists, and seed set for fungicide-treated and control plants.
   Key results: Fungicide effects varied among traits, between
   interactions, and with environmental context. Treatment effects were
   negligible in 2008, but stronger in 2009, especially in the less-fertile
   krummholz habitat. There, fungicide increased nectar sugar content and
   damage by larcenist ants, but did not affect pollination. Surprisingly,
   fungicide also enhanced seed set, suggesting that direct resource costs
   of soil fungi exceed indirect benefits from reduced larceny. In the
   tundra, fungicide effects were negligible in both years. However, pooled
   across treatments, colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in 2009 correlated
   negatively with the intensity and diversity of floral volatile organic
   compounds, suggesting integrated above-and belowground signaling
   pathways.
   Conclusions: Fungicide effects on floral rewards in P. viscosum link
   soil fungi to ecological costs of pollinator attraction. Trait-specific
   linkages to soil fungi should decouple expression of sensitive and
   buffered floral phenotypes in P. viscosum. Overall, this study
   demonstrates how multitrophic linkages may lead to shifting selection
   pressures on interaction traits, restricting the evolution of
   specialization.}},

Abstract = {{Many antagonistic species attack plants and consume specific plant

   individually and in combination is an important research focus in
   ecology and evolution. We examined the individual and combined effects
   of herbivory, nectar robbing, and pre-dispersal seed predation on male

   By examining the effects of antagonists on plant traits, we were able to
   tease apart the direct consumptive effects of antagonists versus the
   indirect effects mediated through changes in traits important to
   pollination. In a three-way factorial field experiment, we manipulated
   herbivory, nectar robbing, and seed predation. Herbivory and seed
   predation reduced some male and female fitness estimates, whereas plants
   tolerated the effects of robbing. The effects of herbivory, robbing, and
   seed predation were primarily additive, and we found little evidence for
   non-additive effects of multiple antagonists on plant reproduction.
   Herbivory affected plant reproduction through both direct consumptive
   effects and indirectly through changes in traits important to
   pollination (i.e., nectar and phenological traits). Conversely, seed
   predators primarily had direct consumptive effects on plants. Our
   results suggest that the effects of multiple antagonists on estimates of

Abstract = {{This study investigated the potential of a root rot causing fungal
   pathogen to affect the geographical distribution of plant species. A
   glasshouse experiment was conducted that compared the responses of
   congeneric plant species of contrasting range types to the presence or
   absence of a soil borne fungal pathogen at three different moisture
   levels. Five congeneric plant species pairs were selected, each with one
   species present and one absent in humid western Europe: Centaurea
   scabiosa-C. stoebe, Dianthus deltoides-D. carthusianorum, Inula
   conyzae-I. hirta, Potentilla neumanniana-P. cinerea and Scabiosa
   columbaria-S. ochroleuca. The oomycete Pythium ultimum was selected as
   the root rot causing soil borne pathogen because of its wide
   geographical distribution, wide host range and reported preference for
   high soil moisture. The response variables measured included relative
   growth rates of above- and belowground biomass, leaf number and the
   shoot-root ratio. Two plant species pairs (Dianthus and Scabiosa) showed
   a significant interaction of distribution type with presence of the
   pathogen. The species with a continental distribution suffered a greater
   reduction in growth due to the pathogen than the species with an oceanic
   distribution. However, across all species and genera the pathogen's
   effect was not dependent on range type or soil moisture and affected
   only RGR of leaf number. The study revealed that unspecialized fungal
   pathogens might have an effect on the performance of some plant species
   and might affect continentally distributed species more than oceanic
   ones, which might put them at disadvantage when combined with, for
   example, competition. Nevertheless, this effect was not recorded for all
   genera tested. Given the little knowledge on the effects of
   unspecialized pathogens on wild plant species, further studies with
   different soil borne fungal pathogens causing root rot and an enlarged

Abstract = {{Although the primary function of mating is gamete transfer, male
   ejaculates contain numerous other substances that are produced by
   accessory glands and transferred to females during mating. Studies with
   several model organisms have shown that these substances can exert
   diverse behavioural and physiological effects on females, including
   altered longevity and reproductive output, yet a comprehensive synthesis
   across taxa is lacking. Here we use a meta-analytic approach to
   synthesize quantitatively extensive experimental work examining how male
   ejaculate quantity affects different components of female fitness. We
   summarize effect sizes for female fecundity (partial and lifetime) and
   longevity from 84 studies conducted on 70 arthropod species that yielded
   a total of 130 comparisons of female fecundity and 61 comparisons of
   female longevity. In response to greater amounts of ejaculate, arthropod
   females demonstrate enhanced fecundity (both partial and lifetime) but
   reduced longevity, particularly for Diptera and Lepidoptera. Across
   taxa, multiply mated females show particularly large fecundity increases
   compared to singly mated females, indicating that single matings do not
   maximize female fitness. This fecundity increase is balanced by a slight
   negative effect on lifespan, with females that received more ejaculate
   through polyandrous matings showing greater reductions in lifespan
   compared with females that have mated repeatedly with the same male. We
   found no significant effect size differences for either female fecundity
   or longevity between taxa that transfer sperm packaged into
   spermatophores compared to taxa that transfer ejaculates containing free
   sperm. Furthermore, females that received relatively larger or more
   spermatophores demonstrated greater lifetime fecundity, indicating that
   these seminal nuptial gifts provide females with a net fitness benefit.
   These results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary origin
   and maintenance of non-sperm ejaculate components, and provide insight
   into female mate choice and optimal mating patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between species pairs are almost always mediated by
   interactions with other species. The outcomes of these multispecies
   interactions are often difficult to predict and are rarely studied. In
   addition to their theoretical importance, multispecies interactions are
   also important for management situations. Where multiple agents are used
   to control invasive species, interactions between agents may either
   enhance or reduce the impacts on the target species, or may simply have
   additive effects. In this study, conducted in a Mediterranean-type
   woodland in Australia, we examined how the interaction between an
   invasive legume, Cytisus scoparius (Leguminosae), its pollinator, Apis
   mellifera and a seed predator, Bruchidius villosus (Bruchidae), are
   modified by a native hemiparasitic vine, Cassytha pubescens
   (Loranthaceae). The parasite had a direct negative effect on C.
   scoparius, reducing flowering by 50\% and consequently fruit and seed
   production. Despite having fewer flowers, infected plants had the same
   proportion of `tripped' flowers, an indirect measure of pollinator
   visitation, as uninfected plants; although fruit formed on infected
   plants it was more likely to abort prematurely. Seed predation by B.
   villosus was lower on parasite-infected C. scoparius plants than in
   uninfected plants. Although Ca. pubescens had an antagonistic effect on
   B. villosus, in consort, the two agents reduced overall seed production
   by an average of 62\%. The acquired parasite Ca. pubescens was more
   effective in reducing reproductive output than the introduced seed
   predator, B. villosus, and shows potential as a biocontrol agent for C.
   scoparius. We documented a subadditive effect of two biological enemies
   on the invasive species, where the acquired parasite had a stronger
   effect than the introduced seed predator.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of mutualism have emphasized both that the net benefit to
   participants depends on the ecological context and that the
   density-dependent pattern of benefit is key to understanding the
   population dynamics of mutualism. Indeed, changes in the ecological
   context are likely to drive changes in both the magnitude of benefit and
   the density-dependent pattern of benefit. Despite the close linkage
   between these two areas of research, however, few studies have addressed
   the factors underlying variation in the density-dependent pattern of
   benefit. Here I use model selection to evaluate how variation in the
   benefits of a mutualism drives temporal variation in the
   density-dependent pattern of net benefit for the ant-tended treehopper
   Publilia concava. In the interaction between ants and treehoppers in the
   genus Publilia, ants collect the sugary excretions of treehoppers as a
   food resource, and treehoppers benefit both directly (e.g., by feeding
   facilitation) and indirectly (e.g., by predator protection). Results
   presented here show that temporal changes in the relative magnitude of
   direct and indirect benefit components of ant tending, especially the
   effectiveness of predator protection by ants, qualitatively change the
   overall pattern of density-dependent benefit between years with maximum
   benefit shifting from treehoppers in small to large aggregations. These
   results emphasize the need for empirical studies that evaluate the

Abstract = {{Plants infected with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes carry
   their microbial symbionts with them during dispersal into new areas.
   Yet, whether seed-borne endophytes enhance the host plant's ability to
   overcome colonisation barriers and to regenerate within invaded sites

   endophytic fungi (Neotyphodium) affected establishment and seed loss to
   predators in the invasive annual grass Lolium multiflorum (Italian
   ryegrass) across contrasting successional plots. Italian ryegrass seeds
   with high and low endophyte incidence were sown into three communities:
   a 1-year-old fallow field, a 15-year-old grassland, and a 24-year-old
   forest, which conformed to an old-field chronosequence in the eastern
   Inland Pampa, Argentina. We found that endophyte infection consistently
   increased host population recruitment and reproductive output. Endophyte
   presence also enhanced aerial biomass production of ryegrass in a low
   recruitment year but not in a high recruitment year, suggesting that
   symbiotic effects on growth performance are density dependent. Endophyte
   presence reduced seed removal by rodents, although differential
   predation may not account for the increased success of infected grass
   populations. Overall, there was no statistical evidence for an
   endophyte-by-site interaction, indicating that the fungal endosymbiont
   benefitted host establishment regardless of large differences in biotic

Abstract = {{The continuing exponential increase in scientific knowledge, the growing
   availability of large databases containing raw or partially annotated
   information, and the increased need to document impacts of large-scale
   research and funding programs provide a great incentive for integrating
   and adding value to previously published (or unpublished) research
   through quantitative synthesis. Meta-analysis has become the standard
   for quantitative evidence synthesis in many disciplines, offering a
   broadly accepted and statistically powerful framework for estimating the
   magnitude, consistency, and homogeneity of the effect of interest across
   studies. Here, we review previous and current uses of meta-analysis in
   plant pathology with a focus on applications in epidemiology and disease
   management. About a dozen formal meta-analyses have been published in
   the plant pathological literature in the past decade, and several more
   are currently in progress. Three broad research questions have been
   addressed, the most common being the comparative efficacy of chemical
   treatments for managing disease and reducing yield loss across
   environments. The second most common application has been the
   quantification of relationships between disease intensity and yield, or
   between different measures of disease, across studies. Lastly,
   metaanalysis has been applied to assess factors affecting pathogen
   biocontrol agent interactions or the effectiveness of biological control
   of plant disease or weeds. In recent years, fixed-effects meta-analysis
   has been largely replaced by random- (or mixed-) effects analysis owing
   to the statistical benefits associated with the latter and the wider
   availability of computer software to conduct these analyses. Another
   recent trend has been the more common use of multivariate meta-analysis
   or meta-regression to analyze the impacts of study-level independent
   variables (moderator variables) on the response of interest. The
   application of meta-analysis to practical problems in epidemiology and
   disease management is illustrated with case studies from our work on
   Phakopsora pachyrhizi on soybean and Erwinia amylovora on apple. We show
   that although meta-analyses are often used to corroborate and validate
   general conclusions drawn from more traditional, qualitative reviews,
   they can also reveal new patterns and interpretations not obvious from
   individual studies.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plants may be attacked both above ground and below ground. Few
   studies have, however, investigated the simultaneous effects of
   above-ground and below-ground herbivory. In the present study, we report
   the effects of beetle herbivory and nematode infection on alligator
   weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides, an invasive plant in China. We found
   that the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita widely occurred on the
   plant in south China. To examine its effect on the plant in conjunction
   with above-ground herbivory, we conducted a field common garden
   experiment with a local insect defoliator, Cassida piperata. We also
   included the native congener Alternanthera sessilis in our experiments
   for a comparison of the response of invasive and native species. We
   found no significant effects on plant biomass of the nematode infection
   in conjunction with the above-ground herbivory. Further chemical
   analysis, however, showed that the water-soluble carbohydrate content in
   roots of A. philoxeroides was significantly increased in plants attacked
   by both the nematode and the herbivore compared with the water-soluble
   carbohydrate content in plants attacked by only the nematode or
   herbivore alone. We found no such change in the native congener A.

Abstract = {{The link between reproductive and vegetative ecology of flowering plants
   is rarely explored, despite its importance for understanding population
   processes and fitness. This link can be studied by using experimental or
   natural variation in seed input to the soil to assess how reproductive
   success affects vital rates of offspring. We previously reported for
   Ipomopsis aggregata that per-seed probability of germinating is
   insensitive to density of seeds sown into plots, whereas per capita
   flower production among adults that grow from the seedlings declines in
   nonlinear fashion with density. Here we describe a parallel
   non-experimental study. We related seedling emergence to estimated
   natural seed input ('seed rain') in three populations across ten summers
   and monitored seedlings that emerged in the first two summers throughout
   their life histories. Seedling emergence in 1996 was linearly related to
   seed rain from plants that flowered in 1995. This density independent
   seed-to-seedling transition recurred over the next nine summers, but the
   slope varied with springtime precipitation. Total numbers of 1996
   seedlings that survived to flower and numbers of flowers they produced
   increased linearly with seed rain in one population, but did not vary
   detectably in the other two, consistent with negative density
   dependence. In consequence lambda (the dominant eigenvalue of a
   population projection matrix) decreased from high values at low
   densities of seed rain to a relatively constant low value with greater
   seed rain. We also detected density dependence in the 1995 seedling
   cohort in survival and flower production. The similarity of results from
   natural and experimental studies supports a conclusion of nonlinear
   density dependence and shows that characterizing it requires the full
   life history. For this plant species and others, studies of pollination
   and fecundity alone may not suffice to draw conclusions about population
   change or fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding cooperation is a central challenge in biology, because
   natural selection should favor ``free-loaders{''} that reap benefits
   without reciprocating. For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most
   approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual
   partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial
   partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most
   mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with
   shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees
   and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout
   ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively
   affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding
   the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia
   drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose
   short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using
   a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering
   sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a
   tree. These sets include a ``sterilization parasite{''} that prevents
   reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees
   associating with partner sets that include these ``parasites{''} enhance
   lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different
   life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating
   mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan
   inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face
   of exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of invasive plants are influenced by positive
   and negative associations formed with members of the fauna present in
   the introduced range. For example, mutualistic associations formed with
   pollinators or seed dispersers may facilitate invasion, but reduced
   fitness from attack by native herbivores can also suppress it. Since
   population expansion depends on effective seed dispersal, interactions
   with seed dispersers and predators in a plant species introduced range
   may be of particular importance. We explored the relative contributions
   of potential seed dispersers (ants) and vertebrate predators (rodents
   and birds) to seed removal of two diplochorous (i.e., wind- and
   ant-dispersed), invasive thistles, Cirsium arvense and Carduus nutans,
   in Colorado, USA. We also conducted behavior trials to explore the
   potential of different ant species to disperse seeds, and we quantified
   which potential ant dispersers were prevalent at our study locations.
   Both ants and vertebrate predators removed significant amounts of C.
   arvense and C. nutans seed, with the relative proportion of seed removed
   by each guild varying by location. The behavior trials revealed clear
   seed preferences among three ant species as well as differences in the
   foragers' abilities to move seeds. In addition, two ant species that
   acted as potential dispersal agents were dominant at the study
   locations. Since local conditions in part determined whether dispersers
   or predators removed more seed, it is possible that some thistle
   populations benefit from a net dispersal effect, while others suffer
   proportionally more predation. Additionally, because the effectiveness
   of potential ant dispersers is taxon-specific, changes in ant community
   composition could affect the seed-dispersal dynamics of these thistles.
   Until now, most studies describing dispersal dynamics in C. arvense and
   C. nutans have focused on primary dispersal by wind or pre-dispersal
   seed predation by insects. Our findings suggest that animal-mediated
   dispersal and post-dispersal seed predation deserve further
   consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between biological control agents and how they impact on

   Puccinia myrsiphylli (Thuem.) Wint. and an undescribed leafhopper (Tribe
   Erythroneurini, formerly referred to as Zygina sp.) introduced for the
   biological control of the invasive plant bridal creeper (Asparagus
   asparagoides (L.) Druce) in Australia. Bridal creeper is a geophyte with
   extensive rhizomes and tubers from which climbing foliage is produced
   annually. The response of individual bridal creeper plants following
   exposure to the agents was measured in exclusion experiments in a
   glasshouse (using cages) and in the field (using pesticides). In the
   glasshouse experiment, the two agents acting together had an additive
   impact on all growth parameters measured, except the above-ground
   biomass for which an effect equivalent to that caused by the rust fungus
   alone was observed. The agents acted synergistically in reducing the
   relative growth rate of rhizome length, tuber number and tuber biomass.
   Depletion of storage organs occurred in treatments comprising the rust
   fungus solely or both agents. While phytotoxicity occurred in treatments
   involving insecticide applications in the field experiment, results from
   the other treatments corresponded with those of the glasshouse
   experiment. In both experiments, leafhopper damage decreased as
   infection by the rust fungus increased. This study provides additional
   evidence of the potential gains to be made from deploying multiple

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Insect herbivores and fungal pathogens can independently affect plant
   fitness, and may have interactive effects. However, few studies have
   experimentally quantified the joint effects of insects and fungal
   pathogens on seed production in non-agricultural populations. We
   examined the factorial effects of insect herbivore exclusion (via
   insecticide) and fungal pathogen exclusion (via fungicide) on the
   population-level seed production of four common graminoid species
   (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Poa pratensis, and Carex
   siccata) over two growing seasons in Minnesota, USA. We detected no
   interactive effects of herbivores and pathogens on seed production.
   However, the seed production of all four species was affected by either
   insecticide or fungicide in at least one year of the study. Insecticide
   consistently doubled the seed production of the historically most common
   species in the North American tallgrass prairie, A. gerardii (big
   bluestem). This is the first report of insect removal increasing seed
   production in this species. Insecticide increased A. gerardii number of
   seeds per seed head in one year, and mass per seed in both years,
   suggesting that consumption of flowers and seed embryos contributed to
   the effect on seed production. One of the primary insect species
   consuming A. gerardii flowers and seed embryos was likely the
   Cecidomyiid midge, Contarinia wattsi. Effects on all other plant species
   varied among years. Herbivores and pathogens likely reduce the dispersal
   and colonization ability of plants when they reduce seed output.
   Therefore, impacts on seed production of competitive dominant species
   may help to explain their relatively poor colonization abilities.
   Reduced seed output by dominant graminoids may thereby promote
   coexistence with subdominant species through competition-colonization
   tradeoffs.}},

Abstract = {{Plants interact with numerous enemies and mutualists simultaneously and
   sequentially. Such multispecies interactions can give rise to
   trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature
   but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding
   multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological
   control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to
   biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed.
   Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in
   California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant
   biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to
   quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved
   biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant
   performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the
   plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the
   nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference
   between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the
   weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the
   adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils.
   Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator
   visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the
   weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by
   the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one
   species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting
   species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be
   necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a
   complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively
   tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies
   interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native
   systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established

Abstract = {{Adaptive phenotypic plasticity allows sessile organisms such as plants
   to match trait expression to the particular environment they experience.
   Plasticity may be limited, however, by resources in the environment, by

   expression of plastic traits and their effects on plant performance
   requires evaluating trait expression in complex environments, rather
   than across levels of a single variable. In this study, we tested the
   independent and combined effects of two components of a plant's
   environment, herbivory and water availability, on the expression of
   attractive and defensive traits in Nicotiana quadrivalvis in the
   greenhouse. Damage and drought did not affect leaf nicotine
   concentrations but had additive and non-additive effects on floral
   attractive and defensive traits. Plants in the high water treatment
   produced larger flowers with more nectar than in the low water
   treatment. Leaf damage induced greater nectar volumes in the high water
   treatment only, suggesting that low water limited plastic responses to
   herbivore damage. Leaf damage also tended to induce higher nicotine
   concentrations in nectar, consistent with other studies showing that
   leaf damage can induce floral defenses. Our results suggest that there

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Biological mutualisms rely on communication between
   partners, but also require protective measures against exploitation.
   Animal-pollinated flowers need to attract pollinators but also to avoid
   conflicts with antagonistic consumers. The view of flower visitors as
   mutualistic and antagonistic agents considers primarily the plants'
   interest. A classification emphasizing the consumer's point of view,
   however, may be more useful when considering animal's adaptations to
   flower visits which may include a tolerance against defensive floral
   scent compounds.
   Methods In a meta-analysis covering 18 studies on the responses of
   animals to floral scents, the animals were assigned to the categories of
   obligate and facultative flower visitors which considers their
   dependency on floral resources. Their responses on floral scents were
   compared.
   Key Results On average, obligate flower visitors, often corresponding to
   pollinators, were attracted to floral scent compounds. In contrast,
   facultative and mainly antagonistic visitors were strongly repelled by
   floral scents. The findings confirm that floral scents have a dual
   function both as attractive and defensive cues.
   Conclusions Whether an animal depends on floral resources determines its
   response to these signals, suggesting that obligate flower visitors
   evolved a tolerance against primarily defensive compounds. Therefore,
   floral scent bouquets in conjunction with nutritious rewards may solve
   the conflicting tasks of attracting mutualists while repelling

Abstract = {{The raw material for evolution is variation. Consequently, identifying
   the factors that generate, maintain, and erode phenotypic and genetic
   variation in ecologically important traits within and among populations
   is important. Although persistent directional or stabilizing selection
   can deplete variation, spatial variation in conflicting directional
   selection can enhance variation. Here, we present evidence that
   phenotypic variation in limber pine ( Pinus flexilis) cone structure is
   enhanced by conflicting selection pressures exerted by its mutualistic
   seed disperser ( Clark's nutcracker Nucifraga columbiana) and an
   antagonistic seed predator ( pine squirrel Tamiasciurus spp.).
   Phenotypic variation in cone structure was bimodal and about two times
   greater where both agents of selection co-occurred than where one ( the
   seed predator) was absent. Within the region where both agents of
   selection co-occurred, bimodality in cone structure was pronounced where
   there appears to be a mosaic of habitats with some persistent habitats
   supporting only the seed disperser. These results indicate that
   conflicting selection stemming from spatial variation in community
   diversity can enhance phenotypic variation in ecologically important
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{P>Mycorrhizal fungi influence plant growth, local biodiversity and
   ecosystem function. Effects of the symbiosis on plants span the
   continuum from mutualism to parasitism. We sought to understand this
   variation in symbiotic function using meta-analysis with information
   theory-based model selection to assess the relative importance of
   factors in five categories: (1) identity of the host plant and its
   functional characteristics, (2) identity and type of mycorrhizal fungi
   (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal), (3) soil fertility, (4)
   biotic complexity of the soil and (5) experimental location (laboratory
   vs. field). Across most subsets of the data, host plant functional group
   and N-fertilization were surprisingly much more important in predicting
   plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation ('plant response') than other
   factors. Non-N-fixing forbs and woody plants and C-4 grasses responded
   more positively to mycorrhizal inoculation than plants with N-fixing
   bacterial symbionts and C-3 grasses. In laboratory studies of the
   arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, plant response was more positive when
   the soil community was more complex. Univariate analyses supported the
   hypothesis that plant response is most positive when plants are
   P-limited rather than N-limited. These results emphasize that
   mycorrhizal function depends on both abiotic and biotic context, and
   have implications for plant community theory and restoration ecology.}},

Abstract = {{High herbivore pressure is expected to benefit unpalatable species that

   Detailed Studies of one species in natural populations, Arisaema

   correlates with reduced plant size and seed rain and male-biased sex
   ratios of co-occurring Arisaema populations. Analyses of individual size
   in five unpalatable forest plant species in long-term experimental
   paired deer exclosure/deer access plots corroborate the natural site
   results; all five species were smaller in deer access plots. Analyses of
   abiotic variables in natural and experimental sites suggest one
   potential mechanism for indirect effects of deer. Deer-mediated soil
   quality declines included increased soil penetration resistance and
   decreased leaf litter depth, which are known to hinder plant growth. Our
   results are likely applicable to other unpalatable forest species and
   have clear consequences for understory biodiversity. Unpalatable plant

Abstract = {{Competition experiments estimating the relative effects of inter- and

   such experiments have focused on invasive Aedes albopictus and its
   interactions with resident Aedes. A meta-analysis of such experiments
   tested whether the effect of interspecific competition is greater than,
   less than, or equal to that of intraspecific competition, and whether
   competitive outcomes are dependent on food quality. For A. albopictus
   and A. aegypti, there was significant context dependence, with
   interspecific competitive advantage for A. albopictus with low food
   quality, and competitive equivalence with high food quality.
   Meta-analysis of survivorship yielded more significant effects than did
   estimated rate of increase. Competitive effects and competitive
   responses of each species yielded similar results. This meta-analysis
   suggests competitive exclusion of A. aegypti by A. albopictus, and is
   thus consistent with field sampling, qualitative reviews, and
   interpretations from individual publications. For A. albopictus and A.

   be placed on estimating species' inter- and intraspecific competitive
   effects, rather than the more common, but theoretically less
   interesting, competitive responses. Experiments without low-density
   controls (i.e., replacement series) are inadequate for comparing

Volume = {{97}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Traditionally, techniques of plant manipulation during restoration
   have focused on the reduction of competition by `problematic' existing
   vegetation. However, the increasing recognition of facilitation as a
   main process regulating the composition of communities has brought a
   change in the practice of restoration towards a better awareness of the
   benefits inherent to conserving neighbouring vegetation.
   2. Here, I provide the results of a meta-analysis of published studies
   that have manipulated interactions among plants with the objective of
   restoring degraded terrestrial systems. I created four different data
   sets corresponding to the variables most commonly used to measure plant
   performance (i.e. emergence, survival, growth and density), and asked
   whether the benefits of facilitation as a restoration tool vary
   depending on the study duration, the life-form of the neighbour and
   target species, and the ecosystem type.
   3. Neighbour effects varied strongly among performance estimators.
   Positive effects were frequently found for emergence and survival,
   whereas neutral or negative interactions predominated for growth and
   density.
   4. No clear support existed for a relationship between study duration
   and neighbour effect.
   5. The life-form of the interacting species, particularly of neighbours,
   largely influenced the interaction outcome. Herbs had strong negative
   effects, especially on other herb species, whereas shrubs had large
   facilitative effects, especially on trees.
   6. Semiarid and tropical systems showed in general more positive
   neighbour effects than wetlands and particularly mesic temperate
   systems, where negative interactions predominated. However, these
   results were largely influenced by the over-representation of herb
   species in wetlands and temperate habitats, survival facilitation being
   found in all systems when only woody species were considered.
   7. Synthesis. Pre-existing vegetation can have large impacts on species
   establishment in degraded habitats. Inhibition predominates in
   herbaceous communities typical of early-successional stages, whereas
   facilitation prevailes in communities dominated by shrubs and trees.
   Even productive systems (e.g. mesic temperate habitats) appear suitable
   for the application of facilitation as a restoration tool of woody
   communities. Whereas restoring herbaceous communities seems largely
   reliable on removal techniques, augmenting populations of nurse shrubs
   and trees should be considered a promising strategy for restoring woody
   late-successional communities.}},

Abstract = {{Context dependency, variation in the outcome of species interactions
   with biotic and abiotic conditions, is increasingly considered
   ubiquitous among mutualisms. Despite several qualitative reviews of many
   individual empirical studies, there has been little quantitative
   synthesis examining the generality of context dependency, or conditions
   that may promote it. We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant
   protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context-dependent
   effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth,
   reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not
   generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and
   rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory
   and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater
   than 0. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however.
   Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic
   or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extra. oral nectar,
   food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or
   latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did
   contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in
   herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and
   greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of
   ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with
   latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory
   were greater in tropical vs. temperate systems. Although ant-plant
   interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of
   mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta-analyses, indicate
   that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic
   interactions. Rather, ant-plant protection mutualisms appear to be
   routinely positive for plants, and only occasionally neutral.}},

Abstract = {{Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial
   biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising
   atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations generally increase
   plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help
   mitigate atmospheric CO(2) rise and global warming. But to what extent
   mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not
   only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO(2), but
   also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background.
   Meta-analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single
   studies. Four recent meta-analyses addressed this issue but reached
   somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO(2) on
   soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N)
   inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these
   conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four
   meta-analyses included different studies, derived different effect size
   estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and
   metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address
   nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the
   mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to
   independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta-analysts
   critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and
   weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence.
   Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the
   basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set,
   confirms that the effect of elevated CO(2) on net soil C accumulation
   increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low
   N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect
   biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with
   meta-analysis, suggesting the continued need for long-term experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between natural enemy species may modify their net effect
   on host plants, but little research has been done to examine how plant
   resistance influences species interactions in biological weed control.
   We performed common garden experiments with clonal accessions of
   Chondrilla juncea to compare a rust-susceptible weed biotype with a
   rust-resistant biotype, both of which are invasive in western North
   America. Inoculations with two biological control organisms, a rust
   fungus pathogen (Puccinia chondrillina) and an eriophyid gall mite
   (Eriophyes chondrillae), were applied separately and in combination to
   test if plant performance is modified by antagonistic or facilitative
   species interactions. We found no significant rust x mite interaction
   effects for several plant traits (shoot length, shoot dry biomass,
   fecundity, rosette growth, and rosette senescence), and therefore the
   two natural enemies appear to have independent and complementary effects
   on plant performance. As expected, genetic resistance of weed biotypes
   modified the effects of rust disease on shoots and rosettes, although
   not for plant fecundity. We found no significant biotype x mite effects
   on plant performance traits. However, rust inoculation reduced the total
   dry biomass of mite galls in the rust-susceptible biotype by indirect
   competition due to decreased growth of diseased shoots, but not in the
   rust-resistant biotype. Our results indicate that rust disease may have
   the potential to modify mite gall epidemiology and relative plant
   performance in mixed populations of resistant and susceptible C juncea
   biotypes, though at present the geographic distributions of these North
   American biotypes are mainly separate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Although the ecological and evolutionary consequences of foliar
   herbivory are well understood, how plants cope with floral damage is
   less well explored. Here the concept of tolerance, typically studied
   within the context of plant defence to foliar herbivores and pathogens,
   is extended to floral damage. Variation in tolerance to floral damage is
   examined, together with some of the mechanisms involved.
   The study was conducted on Ipomopsis aggregata, which experiences floral
   damage and nectar removal by nectar-robbing bees. High levels of robbing
   can reduce seeds sired and produced by up to 50 \%, an indirect effect
   mediated through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants. Using an
   experimental common garden with groups of I. aggregata, realized
   tolerance to robbing was measured. Realized tolerance included both
   genetic and environmental components of tolerance. It was hypothesized
   that both resource acquisition and storage traits, and traits involved
   in pollination would mitigate the negative effects of robbers.
   Groups of I. aggregata varied in their ability to tolerate nectar
   robbing. Realized tolerance was observed only through a component of
   male plant reproduction (pollen donation) and not through components of
   female plant reproduction. Some groups fully compensated for robbing
   while others under- or overcompensated. Evidence was found only for a
   pollination-related trait, flower production, associated with realized
   tolerance. Plants that produced more flowers and that had a higher
   inducibility of flower production following robbing were more able to
   compensate through male function.
   Variation in realized tolerance to nectar robbing was found in I.
   aggregata, but only through an estimate of male reproduction, and traits
   associated with pollination may confer realized tolerance to robbing. By
   linking concepts and techniques from studies of plant-pollinator and
   plant-herbivore interactions, this work provides insight into the role
   of floral traits in pollinator attraction as well as plant defence.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities can be affected both by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) and hemiparasitic plants. However, little is known about the
   interactive effects of these two biotic factors on the productivity and
   diversity of plant communities. To address this question, we set up a
   greenhouse study in which different AMF inocula and a hemiparasitic
   plant (Rhinanthus minor) were added to experimental grassland
   communities in a fully factorial design. In addition, single plants of
   each species in the grassland community were grown with the same
   treatments to distinguish direct AMF effects from indirect effects via
   plant competition. We found that AMF changed plant community structure
   by influencing the plant species differently. At the community level,
   AMF decreased the productivity by 15-24\%, depending on the particular
   AMF treatment, mainly because two dominant species, Holcus lanatus and
   Plantago lanceolata, showed a negative mycorrhizal dependency.
   Concomitantly, plant diversity increased due to AMF inoculation and was
   highest in the treatment with a combination of two commercial AM
   strains. AMF had a positive effect on growth of the hemiparasite, and
   thereby induced a negative impact of the hemiparasite on host plant
   biomass which was not found in non-inoculated communities. However, the
   hemiparasite did not increase plant diversity. Our results highlight the
   importance of interactions with soil microbes for plant community
   structure and that these indirect effects can vary among AMF treatments.
   We conclude that mutualistic interactions with AMF, but not antagonistic
   interactions with a root hemiparasite, promote plant diversity in this
   grassland community.}},

   grown in a bare-root nursery. In total, we surveyed 32 nurseries that
   were each active in supplying planting stocks to restock forests and for
   afforestation of post-agricultural land. Sequence-based approach was
   used to identify EMF taxa, quantify EMF richness, and document
   differences in the relative abundance of individual taxa. We identified
   seven fungal species that might contribute to the mycorrhizal community
   structure of 1 to 3-year-old L. decidua seedlings. The species richness
   in the examined larches varied between one and four fungal taxa,
   depending on both the nursery stock samples (NSS) and age class of the
   seedlings. The average was 1.4 for 1-year-old seedlings and 2.3 for 2-
   and 3-year-old plants. The dominance of Ascomycota over Basidiomycota
   and the prevalence of two species, Wilcoxina mikolae and Suillus
   grevillei, as EMF partners were characteristic features of nursery-grown
   L. decidua seedlings. S. grevillei was the only one basidiomycetes
   colonized roots of tested seedlings. The rest of the mycorrhizal pool

Abstract = {{Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative
   effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely
   unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more
   stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative
   effects in individual studies were additive (26\%), synergistic (36\%),
   and antagonistic (38\%). The overall interaction effect across all
   studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level
   (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level
   (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific
   stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and
   antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects
   significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of
   synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in
   laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these
   three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in
   nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While
   significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results
   suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in
   ecological studies and conservation planning.}},

Abstract = {{Tolerance of foliar damage is widely recognized as an effective defense
   against herbivores and pathogens. However, tolerance of the impacts of
   antagonists on pollination success is less well understood. Here, we
   extend the framework of tolerance to foliar damage to understand how
   plants mitigate the pollination and fitness costs of. oral larceny
   (i.e., the consumption of. oral nectar often without pollination). We
   focused on two mechanisms: high nectar rewards per flower to feed all.
   oral visitors and high flower production to compensate for reproductive
   losses under reduced pollination and seed set. We compared the efficacy
   of these mechanisms in two plant species: Polemonium viscosum and
   Ipomopsis aggregata. In Polemonium, ants acting as larcenists reduce
   nectar accumulation but do not completely empty flowers. When nectar
   reserves were augmented, ant consumption increased, negating the
   efficacy of this putative tolerance mechanism. Similarly, in Ipomopsis,
   nectar addition had little effect on tolerance to larceny by bumble
   bees, perhaps because residual intact flowers do not have enough nectar
   to compensate for lost rewards. Flower production in both species
   mitigated some of the negative impacts of larceny on seed set. In
   Polemonium,flower number was not plastic in response to larceny, but
   large inflorescences enhanced female fitness only when larcenists were
   present, suggesting that ``surplus'' flowers in large inflorescences can
   function to replace reproductive losses due to larceny. In Ipomopsis,
   high rates of larceny induced flower production, but the fecundity
   benefits of making more flowers declined inversely to larcenist
   intensity. Overall, our results suggest (1) that tolerance to. oral
   larceny involves ``banking'' extra flowers to replace lost reproduction
   rather than maintaining pollination of ones with larceny, and (2) that
   the efficacy of flower production as a tolerance mechanism varies
   inversely to larceny rate.}},

   use three meta-analytical models: a mixed model and two Bayes models,

   PSFs, through negative frequency dependence, maintain plant diversity,

   and natives, but the delta-splitting model indicated that more studies
   are needed for these results to be conclusive. Our results support the
   hypotheses that PSFs encourage successional replacements and plant

Abstract = {{Ecological theory holds that competition and predation are the most

   we expand this framework by demonstrating that mutualism can
   fundamentally alter community and food web structure. In large,
   replicated field plots, we manipulated the mutualism between a dominant
   plant (Lolium arundinaceum) and symbiotic fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium

   up to 70\%, reduced arthropod diversity nearly 20\%, shifted arthropod
   species composition relative to endophyte-free plots and suppressed the
   biomass and richness of other plant species in the community.
   Herbivorous arthropods were more strongly affected than carnivores, and
   for both herbivores and carnivores, effects of the mutualism appeared to
   propagate indirectly via organisms occurring more basally in the food
   web. The influence of the mutualism was as great or greater than

Abstract = {{Pathogens are thought to promote diversity in plant communities by
   preventing competitive exclusion. Previous studies have focussed
   primarily on single-plant, single-pathogen interactions, yet the
   interactions between multiple pathogens and multiple hosts may have
   non-additive impacts on plant community composition. Here, we report
   that both a bacterial and a fungal pathogen maintained the diversity of
   a four-species plant community across five generations; however,
   significant interactions between the pathogens resulted in less plant
   diversity when the two pathogens were present than when the fungal
   pathogen was present alone. Standard models predict that pathogens will
   maintain plant diversity when they cause a disproportionate loss of
   fitness in the dominant plant species. In our experiment, however,
   pathogens maintained plant diversity because the rare species produced
   more seeds through a compensatory response to pathogen infection.
   Finally, we found that the influence of pathogens on maintaining plant
   diversity was 5.5 times greater than the influence of nutrient resource
   heterogeneity. Pathogens may be a major factor in maintaining plant

Abstract = {{Predicting ecosystem responses to global change is a major challenge in
   ecology. A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing
   environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological
   organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics
   can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are
   needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level.
   Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling
   through community processes, but predicting how such changes may
   influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that
   community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions
   using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the
   community response to environmental change (predicted by response
   traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted
   by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional
   framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species'
   response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions
   concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental
   change on function. We then detail several key research directions
   needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the
   community level. These include (1) effect and response trait
   characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3)
   the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4)
   incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing
   rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities

Abstract = {{Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil
   organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt
   with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing
   on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms
   into body size classes or by using whole communities from different
   origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the
   interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms,
   nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant
   communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by
   stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but
   this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non-leguminous
   forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an
   alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes.
   Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant
   community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not
   affected by soil organisms, but Lotus corniculatus flowered earlier in
   the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in
   the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a
   profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by
   counterbalancing the negative effects of plant-feeding nematodes on
   grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We
   propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil
   organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account
   in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may

   Methods: The ants' responses to floral scent bouquets and to individual
   floral volatiles were tested in a modified Pettersson four-arm

   offered to ants to observe whether they accepted or rejected the nectar.
   Results: While ants readily consumed almost all nectar offered to them,

   percentage of fruits destroyed by Hylemya. However, the negative effects
   of robbing on seed production outweighed any advantages associated with
   decreased seed predation in robbed plants. We found similar trends among
   sites when we manipulated robbing to all plants within a local
   population, although the results were not statistically significant.
   Taken together, our results suggest that seed predation is not

   importance of pollen limitation and plant mating system in predicting
   the impacts of nectar robbing on female plant reproduction. We predicted
   that nectar robbing would have the strongest effects on species
   requiring pollinators to set seed and pollen limited for seed
   production. Our predictions were partially supported. In the first
   study, natural nectar robbing was associated with lower seed production
   in Delphinium nuttullianum, a self-compatible but non-autogamously
   selfing, pollen-limited perennial, and experimental nectar robbing
   reduced seed set relative to unrobbed plants. The second study involved
   Linaria vulgaris, a self-incompatible perennial that is generally not
   pollen limited. Natural levels of nectar robbing generally had little
   effect on estimates of female reproduction in L. vulgaris, while
   experimental nectar robbing reduced seed set per fruit but not
